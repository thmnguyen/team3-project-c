1000,25985014,"We investigated the role of surgical ablation targeting the autonomous nervous system during a Cox-Maze IV procedure in the maintenance of sinus rhythm at long-term follow-up.
The patient population consisted of 519 subjects with persistent or long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) undergoing radiofrequency Maze IV during open heart surgery between January 2006 and July 2013 at three institutions without (Group 1) or with (Group 2) ganglionated plexi (GP) ablation. Recurrence of atrial fibrillation off-antiarrhythmic drugs was the primary outcome. Predictors of AF recurrence were evaluated by means of competing risk regression. Median follow-up was 36.7 months.
The percentage of patients in normal sinus rhythm (NSR) off-antiarrhythmic drugs did not differ between groups (Group 1-75.5%, Group 2-67.8%, p = 0.08).

In contrast the absence of GP ablation was not a significant factor (p = 0.12).",Is ganglionated plexi ablation during Maze IV procedure beneficial for postoperative long-term stable sinus rhythm?,No. GP ablation did not prove to be beneficial for postoperative stable NSR. A complete left atrial lesion set and biatrial ablation are advisable for improving rhythm outcomes. Randomized controlled trials are necessary to confirm our findings.,PASS,pubmedQA," The study suggests that ganglionated plexi ablation during the Maze IV procedure does not significantly affect the maintenance of sinus rhythm at long-term follow-up in patients with persistent or long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation (AF). Other factors such as duration of AF, left atrial diameter and area, absence of connecting lesions, and absence of right atrial ablation were found to be independently associated with a high incidence of AF recurrence.

1001,16195477,"Obesity is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Although it is known that white adipose tissue (WAT) produces numerous proinflammatory and proatherogenic cytokines and chemokines, it is unclear whether adipose-derived chemotactic signals affect the chronic inflammation in atherosclerosis.
Histological examination showed that perivascular WAT (pWAT) is in close proximity to vascular walls, particularly at sites that have a tendency to develop atherosclerosis. In rodents, the amount of pWAT is markedly increased by a high-fat diet. At a functional level, supernatant from subcutaneous and pWAT strongly induced the chemotaxis of peripheral blood leukocytes. The migration of granulocytes and monocytes was mostly mediated by interleukin-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, respectively, whereas both chemokines contributed to the migration of activated T cells. Moreover, pWAT produces these chemokines, as shown by immunohistochemistry and by explant culture. The accumulation of macrophages and T cells at the interface between pWAT and the adventitia of human atherosclerotic aortas may reflect this prochemotactic activity of pWAT.",Production of chemokines by perivascular adipose tissue: a role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis?,"Yes. Human pWAT has chemotactic properties through the secretion of different chemokines, and we propose that pWAT might contribute to the progression of obesity-associated atherosclerosis.",PASS,pubmedQA," Yes, perivascular adipose tissue (pWAT) appears to play a role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis by producing chemokines that attract immune cells such as granulocytes, monocytes, and activated T cells towards the vascular walls. These chemotactic signals are primarily mediated by interleukin-8 (IL-8) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), which contribute to chronic inflammation in atherosclerosis. The increased amount of pWAT observed in rodents on a high-fat diet may exacerbate this process, potentially contributing to the increased risk for cardiovascular disease associated with obesity.","Obesity is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease.

1003,20594006,"Tethering of the spinal cord is thought to increase the chance of neurological injury when scoliosis correction is undertaken. All patients with myelomeningocele (MM) are radiographically tethered, and untethering procedures carry significant morbidity risks including worsening neurological function and wound complications. No guidelines exist as regards untethering in patients with MM prior to scoliosis correction surgery. The authors' aim in this study was to evaluate their experience in patients with MM who were not untethered before scoliosis correction.
Seventeen patients with MM were retrospectively identified and 1) had no evidence of a clinically symptomatic tethered cord, 2) had undergone spinal fusion for scoliosis correction, and 3) had not been untethered for at least 1 year prior to surgery. The minimum follow-up after fusion was 2 years. Charts and radiographs were reviewed for neurological or shunt complications in the perioperative period.

Instead, it appears to increase the need for more radical surgeries, the risk of surgical complications, and lower the rates of clear resection margins. However, it's important to note that this study was retrospective in nature and had heterogeneous radiotherapy regimes among the radiotherapy patients, which could have influenced the results. Therefore, further prospective studies with standardized radiotherapy regimes are needed to confirm these findings.","Radiotherapy reduces local recurrence rates but is also capable of short- and long-term toxicity. It may also render treatment of local recurrence more challenging if it develops despite previous radiotherapy.
This study examined the impact of radiotherapy for the primary rectal cancer on outcomes after pelvic exenteration for local recurrence.
We conducted a retrospective review of exenteration databases.
The study took place at a quaternary referral center that specializes in pelvic exenteration.
Patients referred for pelvic exenteration from October 1994 to November 2012 were reviewed. Patients who did and did not receive radiotherapy as part of their primary rectal cancer treatment were compared.
The main outcomes of interest were resection margins, overall survival, disease-free survival, and surgical morbidities.
There were 108 patients, of which 87 were eligible for analysis. Patients who received radiotherapy for their primary rectal cancer (n = 41) required more radical exenterations (68% vs 44%; p = 0.020), had lower rates of clear resection margins (63% vs 87%; p = 0.010), had increased rates of surgical complications per patient (p = 0.014), and had a lower disease-free survival (p = 0.022). Overall survival and disease-free survival in patients with clear margins were also lower in the primary irradiated patients (p = 0.049 and p<0.0001). This difference in survival persisted in multivariate analysis that corrected for T and N stages of the primary tumor.
This study is limited by its retrospective nature and heterogeneous radiotherapy regimes among radiotherapy patients."

1037,15223779,"This study was conducted to investigate the expression and functional impact of the proto-oncogene c-kit in uveal melanoma.
Based on immunohistochemical (IHC) study of paraffin-embedded specimens from 134 uveal melanomas and Western blot analysis on eight fresh-frozen samples the expression of c-kit in uveal melanoma was studied. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of c-kit and the impact of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 was examined in the three uveal melanoma cell lines OCM-1, OCM-3, and 92-1.
Eighty-four of 134 paraffin-embedded samples and six of eight fresh-frozen samples expressed c-kit. c-Kit was strongly expressed and tyrosine phosphorylated in cultured uveal melanoma cells compared with cutaneous melanoma cells. Moreover, in contrast to cutaneous melanoma cell lines c-kit maintained a high phosphorylation level in serum-depleted uveal melanoma cells. No activation-related mutations in exon 11 of the KIT gene were found. On the contrary, expression of the stem cell growth factor (c-kit ligand) was detected in all three uveal melanoma cell lines, suggesting the presence of autocrine (paracrine) stimulation pathways. Treatment of uveal melanoma cell lines with STI571, which blocks c-kit autophosphorylation, resulted in cell death.

The results confirm that c-kit is vastly expressed in uveal melanoma, suggest that the c-kit molecular pathway may be important in uveal melanoma growth, and point to its use as a target for therapy with STI571.",PASS,pubmedQA," Yes, based on this study, c-Kit appears to be a potential therapeutic target for uveal melanoma. The proto-oncogene c-kit is expressed in the majority of uveal melanomas, and its phosphorylation level is higher in uveal melanoma cells compared to cutaneous melanoma cells. This suggests that c-Kit plays a significant role in the growth and survival of uveal melanoma cells.

The study also found that the tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571, which blocks c-kit autophosphorylation, leads to cell death in uveal melanoma cell lines. The IC50 (the concentration required for 50% inhibition) of the inhibitory effects on c-kit phosphorylation and cell proliferation was less than 2.5 microM, indicating a potent effect of STI571 on these cells.

These findings suggest that targeting c-Kit with drugs like STI571 could be an effective strategy for treating uveal melanoma. However, further research is needed to confirm these results and develop more targeted therapies.","This study was conducted to investigate the expression and functional impact of the proto-oncogene c-kit in uveal melanoma.
Based on immunohistochemical (IHC) study of paraffin-embedded specimens from 134 uveal melanomas and Western blot analysis on eight fresh-frozen samples the expression of c-kit in uveal melanoma was studied. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of c-kit and the impact of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 was examined in the three uveal melanoma cell lines OCM-1, OCM-3, and 92-1.
Eighty-four of 134 paraffin-embedded samples and six of eight fresh-frozen samples expressed c-kit. c-Kit was strongly expressed and tyrosine phosphorylated in cultured uveal melanoma cells compared with cutaneous melanoma cells. Moreover, in contrast to cutaneous melanoma cell lines c-kit maintained a high phosphorylation level in serum-depleted uveal melanoma cells. No activation-related mutations in exon 11 of the KIT gene were found. On the contrary, expression of the stem cell growth factor (c-kit ligand) was detected in all three uveal melanoma cell lines, suggesting the presence of autocrine (paracrine) stimulation pathways. Treatment of uveal melanoma cell lines with STI571, which blocks c-kit autophosphorylation, resulted in cell death. The IC(50) of the inhibitory effects on c-kit phosphorylation and cell proliferation was of equal size and less than 2.5 microM."

However, it's important to note that this is just one study and more research may be needed to confirm these findings and understand the underlying mechanisms.","The long-term survival of patients with gastric cancer is governed by various factors, such as the clinical stage of the cancer, the patient's nutritional state, and the treatment and may be governed by the volume of intraperitoneal adipose tissue. The aim of this study is to clarify the relationship between the degree of the patients' body mass index and their long-term survival.
Gastric cancer patients who had undergone a gastrectomy with D2-lymphadenectomy and with resection A and B according to the criteria of the Japanese Research Society for Gastric Cancer Rules were subgrouped into those patients with a body mass index<0.185 (the lower body mass index group) and those patients with a body mass index>0.210 (the higher body mass index group). The patient's morbidity and long-term survival rate was retrospectively compared between the 2 groups.
A significantly longer mean survival rate was observed for the lower body mass index group in stage 2 (1667 vs. 1322 days, P = 0.0240). Also, a significantly longer mean survival rate was observed for the higher BMI group in stage 3a (1431 vs. 943, P = 0.0071)."

Open ileocolic resections for Crohn's disease (Group IV) were associated with higher morbidity, longer hospital stays, and a higher conversion rate to open procedures. This suggests that laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resection may offer advantages in terms of complications and recovery time.

It is important to note that this study compares laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resections with open ileocolic resections, not with each other directly within the same groups. Therefore, direct comparisons between the groups should be made with caution.

It is a biological parameter that is easily, precisely and relatively cheaply measured. The epidemiological features of serum chloride levels have not been studied before.
For the random sample of men and women from the Belgian Interuniversity Research on Nutrition and Health aged 25-74 years, free of symptomatic coronary heart disease at baseline, serum chloride concentrations were measured, among those of other electrolytes. The cohort was followed up for 10 years with respect to subsequent cause-specific mortality.
The results are based on observations of 4793 men and 4313 women.

On the other hand, the Neopuff T-piece resuscitator had issues reaching set peak inflation pressures and exhibited elevated positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) in the infant model, which suggests that it may not be suitable for infants up to 10kg weight. However, it's important to note that this study only compares these two specific devices and more research may be needed to confirm these findings with other similar devices.

There are little comparative data assessing biomechanical performance of common infant manual resuscitation devices across the manufacturers' recommended operating weight ranges. We aimed to compare performance of the Ambu self-inflating bag (SIB) with the Neopuff T-piece resuscitator in three resuscitation models.
Five experienced clinicians delivered targeted ventilation to three lung models differing in compliance, delivery pressures and inflation rates; Preterm (0.5â€…mL/cmH2O, 25/5 cmH2O, 60 per minute), Term (3â€…mL/cmH2O, 30/5 cmH2O, 40 per minute) and Infant (9â€…mL/cmH2O, 35/5 cmH2O, 30 per minute). The Neopuff was examined with three gas inflow rates (5 litres per minute (LPM), 10 LPM and 15 LPM) and the Ambu with no gas inflow.
3309 inflations were collected and analysed with analysis of variance for repeated measures. The Neopuff was unable to reach set peak inflation pressures and exhibited seriously elevated positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) with all inflow gas rates (p<0.001) in this infant model.

For men dying at ages 40-64 the lowest employment grade had 3.12 times the mortality of the highest grade (95% confidence interval 2.4 to 4.1). After retirement the ability of grade to predict mortality declined (rate ratio 1.86; 1.6 to 2.2). A non-work based measure of socioeconomic status (car ownership) predicted mortality less well than employment grade before retirement but its ability to predict mortality declined less after retirement. Using a relative index of inequality that was sensitive to the distribution among socioeconomic groups showed employment grade and car ownership to have independent associations with mortality that were of equal magnitude after retirement. The absolute difference in death rates between the lowest and highest employment grades increased with age from 12.9 per 1000 person years at ages 40-64 to 38.3 per 1000 at ages 70-89."

Nonetheless, further studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods might be needed to confirm these findings. It's always best to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice.","The aim of this study was to determine whether bone scans (BS) can be avoided if pelvis was included in CT thorax and abdomen to detect bony metastases from breast cancer.
Results of 77 pairs of CT (thorax, abdomen, and pelvis) and BS in newly diagnosed patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) were compared prospectively for 12 months. Both scans were blindly assessed by experienced radiologists and discussed at multidisciplinary team meetings regarding the diagnosis of bone metastases.
CT detected metastatic bone lesions in 43 (98%) of 44 patients with bone metastases. The remaining patient had a solitary, asymptomatic bony metastasis in shaft of femur. BS was positive in all patients with bone metastases. There were 11 cases of false positive findings on BS."

Even today, activities around the olive tree constitute major engagements of several people in the countryside of both sides of the Mediterranean basin. The olive fly is, beyond doubt, the most destructive pest of cultivated olives. The female fly leaves its eggs in the olive fruit. Upon emergence, the larvae feed on the olive sap, thus destroying the fruit. If untreated, practically all olives get infected. The use of chemical insecticides constitutes the principal olive fly control approach. The Sterile Insect Technique (SIT), an environmentally friendly alternative control method, had been tried in pilot field applications in the 1970's, albeit with no practical success. This was mainly attributed to the low, non-antagonistic quality of the mixed-sex released insects. Many years of experience from successful SIT applications in related species, primarily the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata, demonstrated that efficient SIT protocols require the availability of fundamental genetic and molecular information.
Among the primary systems whose understanding can contribute towards novel SIT approaches (or its recently developed alternative RIDL: Release of Insects carrying a Dominant Lethal) is the reproductive, since the ability to manipulate the reproductive system would directly affect the insect's fertility. In addition, the analysis of early embryonic promoters and apoptotic genes would provide tools that confer dominant early-embryonic lethality during mass-rearing. Here we report the identification of several genes involved in these systems through whole transcriptome analysis of female accessory glands (FAGs) and spermathecae, as well as male testes. Indeed, analysis of differentially expressed genes in these tissues revealed higher metabolic activity in testes than in FAGs/spermathecae. Furthermore, at least five olfactory-related genes were shown to be differentially expressed in the female and male reproductive systems analyzed. Finally, the expression profile of the embryonic serendipity-Î± locus and the pre-apoptotic head involution defective gene were analyzed during embryonic developmental stages.",Does the molecular biology of the olive fly come of age?,"Yes. Several years of molecular studies on the olive fly can now be combined with new information from whole transcriptome analyses and lead to a deep understanding of the biology of this notorious insect pest.

Our previous microarray studies identified increased expression of a novel protein, the B-cell translocation gene 2 (BTG2), in infarcted regions.
We have used immunohistochemistry and Western blotting to examine the expression and localization of BTG2 in stroked brain tissue and immunofluorescent staining of human fetal brain neurons to determine if oxygen-glucose deprivation affected its expression.
We show that BTG2 is strongly expressed in peri-infarcted and infarcted regions of brain tissue, localizing in neuronal nuclei and cytoplasm, whilst being absent or very weakly expressed in normal looking contralateral tissue. Exposure of human fetal brain neurons to oxygen-glucose deprivation also induced BTG2 expression in the cytoplasm and perinuclear regions of cells staining positive for propidium iodide (a marker of nuclear damage).",Is b-cell translocation gene 2 over-expressed in peri-infarct neurons after ischaemic stroke?,Yes.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of quadriceps muscle fatigue on patterns of muscle activation and performance in response to sudden, unexpected perturbations during a weight-bearing task.
Motion of the knee was measured as subjects were asked to track a visual target as accurately as possible while performing a resisted single leg squat task. Random perturbations were delivered in 20% of the trials by unexpectedly releasing the resistance during the flexion phase of the exercise. Absolute and constant errors were calculated to evaluate target tracking performance. Quadriceps and hamstring muscle activity was recorded during both perturbed and unperturbed trials. Twelve healthy women were tested before and after completing a repetitive submaximal eccentric quadriceps fatigue protocol. A second group of 12 women served as controls. Unexpected perturbations elicited long-latency responses characterized by facilitation of the quadriceps and inhibition of the hamstrings.
Muscle fatigue increased the amplitude of the long-latency response in vastus lateralis by 4.3% maximum voluntary isometric contraction (P = 0.004).

To understand why MiHA-targeted T cells have such a potent antitumor effect it is essential to evaluate their in vivo behavior. In the present work, we therefore addressed two specific questions: what is the proliferative dynamics of H7(a)-specifc T cells in tumors, and do H7(a)-specific T cells persist long-term after adoptive transfer?
By day 3 after adoptive transfer, we observed a selective infiltration of melanomas by anti-H7(a) T cells. Over the next five days, anti-H7(a) T cells expanded massively in the tumor but not in the spleen. Thus, by day 8 after injection, anti-H7(a) T cells in the tumor had undergone more cell divisions than those in the spleen. These data strongly suggest that anti-H7(a) T cells proliferate preferentially and extensively in the tumors. We also found that two host factors regulated long-term persistence of anti-H7(a) memory T cells: thymic function and expression of H7(a) by host cells. On day 100, anti-H7(a) memory T cells were abundant in euthymic H7(a)-negative (B10.H7(b)) mice, present in low numbers in thymectomized H7(a)-positive (B10) hosts, and undetectable in euthymic H7(a)-positive recipients.",Do two host factors regulate persistence of H7-specific T cells injected in tumor-bearing mice?,"Yes. Although in general the tumor environment is not propitious to T-cell invasion and expansion, the present work shows that this limitation may be overcome by adoptive transfer of primed CD8 T cells targeted to an immunodominant MiHA (here H7(a)). At least in some cases, prolonged persistence of adoptively transferred T cells may be valuable for prevention of late cancer relapse in adoptive hosts.

Cluster analysis uncovered thirteen distinct patterns. Pattern A (51% or 1366 of the eyes) showed unimpaired hue discrimination and was comprised of younger patients with no or little macular edema. Pattern B eyes (10% or 262) showed generalized impairment of hue discrimination with no main axis defect. Patterns C (C1, C2, C3), comprising 26% (or 698) of the eyes, showed increasing severity of the yellow-blue diabetic retinopathy defect, associated with increasing mean age and increasing macular edema severity. Patterns D (D1, D2), comprising 6% (or 164) of the eyes, were similar to the C patterns but showed a stronger yellow-blue defect. Patterns E (E1, E2, E3), or approximately 2% (or 38) of the eyes and predominantly male, exhibited the expected pattern for congenital protan defect. Patterns F, G, and H, approximately 6% (or 153) of the eyes, showed distinct patterns of one-sided axes. The nomenclature is arbitrary."

1126,9175815,"Allograft survival can be prolonged by the administration of alloantigen(s) before transplantation. Blood transfusion is the commonest form of alloantigen pretreatment currently used in clinical practice. However, for recipients of organs from cadaver donors, it is not possible to predict the identity of the organ donor in advance. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that all the alloantigens expressed by a cadaver organ donor will be represented in the alloantigen pretreatment inoculum. We have previously shown that it is not necessary to expose the recipient to the full complement of donor alloantigens to induce long-term survival of a subsequent cardiac allograft. Here, we investigated the in vivo mechanism responsible for this phenomena.
Unresponsiveness to the mouse MHC class I molecule Kb was induced in CBA.Ca (H2k) recipients by administration of bone marrow cells from transgenic CBA mice, CBK (H2k + Kb) before transplantation of fully allogeneic and F1 vascularized cardiac allografts.
Pretreatment with CBK bone marrow cells resulted in the long-term survival of all cardiac allografts expressing H2-Kb. For example, C57BL/10 (H2b) and (CBKxBALB/c) F1 (H2k,d + Kb) cardiac allografts were accepted by recipients treated with CBK bone marrow cells before transplantation. In contrast, allografts that did not express Kb, such as BALB/c (H2d) or (CBAxBALB/c) F1 (H2k,d), were rejected acutely, with a median survival time (MST) of 7 and 6 days, respectively, in recipients treated with CBK bone marrow cells. Furthermore, when recipients pretreated with CBK bone marrow cells were grafted with a BALB/c heart and a CBK heart simultaneously, the BALB/c hearts were rejected (MST=10 days), whereas the CBK hearts were accepted. By contrast, in the maintenance phase (i.e., after transplantation), recipients with long-term surviving (CBKxBALB/c) F1 hearts (> 100 days) were found to accept BALB/c hearts indefinitely, whereas fourth-party B10.S (H2s) grafts were rejected (MST=7.5 days).

This phenomenon may be due to a mechanism called linked epitope suppression, where exposure to one alloantigen (Kb) leads to tolerance of other alloantigens expressed by the transplanted heart.

1127,16962471,"Collagens are important components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Alterations in collagen structure and composition can lead to end-stage heart failure. Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are frequently used as a bridge to heart transplantation (HTx). In this study, we analyzed changes in composition of the collagens as well as the synthesis or degradation of these collagens after prolonged LVAD support.
The ECM volume was quantified after Picro-Sirius red staining. With immunohistochemistry (IHC), Type I and Type III collagen proteins were analyzed and, using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), collagen mRNA expression was analyzed. Collagen synthesis and degradation was studied by measuring N-terminal pro-peptide for Type I collagen (PINP), N-terminal pro-peptide for Type III collagen (PIIINP) and carboxyterminal telopeptide for Type I collagen (ICTP) in plasma. Collagen composition was measured using the hydroxyproline/Sircol assay.
The ECM volume increased in the first 200 days after LVAD implantation. At between 200 and 400 days the ECM volume decreased, but remained higher than pre-LVAD. After 400 days the ECM volume was smaller than the pre-LVAD volume. IHC did not show a significant difference pre- and post-LVAD for collagen composition. Collagen mRNA expression did not change but an augmented synthesis of collagen during the first month after LVAD support was detected upon measurement of plasma PINP and PIIINP levels. In addition, the quality of the collagen network improved.",Does reverse remodeling of the myocardial extracellular matrix after prolonged left ventricular assist device support follow a biphasic pattern?,"Yes. Reverse remodeling during LVAD support follows a biphasic pattern. Initially, an increase in Type I and Type III collagen turnover occurs, which is paralleled by a volume increase of the ECM. Subsequently, this turnover decreases as ECM volume decreases, which results in a restoration of the collagen network.",PASS,pubmedQA," Yes, it appears that the remodeling of the myocardial extracellular matrix after prolonged left ventricular assist device support follows a biphasic pattern, as suggested by the findings from this study on MI in mice. The initial phase involves increased expression and accumulation of LOX isoforms and collagen fibers, leading to scar formation and increased stiffness. This is followed by a later phase where treatment with LOX inhibitors or neutralizing antibodies against the canonical LOX isoform attenuates collagen accumulation and maturation, resulting in reduced ventricular dilatation and improved cardiac function. However, it's important to note that this study was conducted on mice and further research would be needed to confirm these findings in humans undergoing prolonged left ventricular assist device support.","After myocardial infarction (MI), extensive remodelling of the extracellular matrix contributes to scar formation. While aiming to preserve tissue integrity, this fibrotic response is also associated with adverse events, including a markedly increased risk of heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. Cardiac fibrosis is characterized by extensive deposition of collagen and also by increased stiffness as a consequence of enhanced collagen cross-linking. Members of the lysyl oxidase (LOX) family of enzymes are responsible for the formation of collagen cross-links. This study investigates the contribution of LOX family members to the heart response to MI.
Experimental MI was induced in C57BL/6 mice by permanent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. The expression of LOX isoforms (LOX and LOXL1-4) was strongly increased upon MI, and this response was accompanied by a significant accumulation of mature collagen fibres in the infarcted area. LOX expression was observed in areas of extensive remodelling, partially overlapping with Î±-smooth muscle actin-expressing myofibroblasts. Tumour growth factor-Î² as well as hypoxia-activated pathways contributed to the induction of LOX expression in cardiac fibroblasts. Finally, in vivo post-infarction treatment with the broadband LOX inhibitor Î²-aminopropionitrile or, selectively, with a neutralizing antibody against the canonical LOX isoform attenuated collagen accumulation and maturation and also resulted in reduced ventricular dilatation and improved cardiac function."

Therefore, the integration of bone-addressed therapeutics in MNPs and their accumulation at a magnetic orthopaedic implant could improve the treatment of implant related infections. In this study a martensitic steel platelet as implant placeholder was used to examine its accumulation and retention capacity of MNPs in an in vitro experimental set up considering different experimental frame conditions as magnet quantity and distance to each other, implant thickness and flow velocity.
The magnetic field strength increased to approximately 112% when a martensitic stainless steel platelet was located between the magnet poles. Therewith a significantly higher amount of magnetic nanoparticles could be accumulated in the area of the platelet compared to the sole magnetic field. During flushing of the tube system mimicking the in vivo blood flow, the magnetized platelet was able to retain a higher amount of MNPs without an external magnetic field compared to the set up with no mounted platelet during flushing of the system. Generally, a higher flow velocity led to lower amounts of accumulated MNPs. A higher quantity of magnets and a lower distance between magnets led to a higher magnetic field strength. Albeit not significantly the magnetic field strength tended to increase with thicker platelets.",Do increased accumulation of magnetic nanoparticles by magnetizable implant materials for the treatment of implant-associated complications?,Yes. A martensitic steel platelet significantly improved the attachment of magnetic nanoparticles in an in vitro flow system and therewith indicates the potential of magnetic implant materials in orthopaedic surgery. The use of a remanent magnetic implant material could improve the efficiency of capturing MNPs especially when the external magnetic field is turned off thus facilitating and prolonging the effect. In this way higher drug levels in the target area might be attained resulting in lower inconveniences for the patient.,PASS,pubmedQA," Yes, the study suggests that the use of a magnetizable implant such as a martensitic steel platelet can indeed increase the accumulation and retention capacity of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) in an area near the implant. This is achieved by increasing the strength of the externally applied magnetic field, which in turn facilitates the accumulation of MNPs. The study also indicates that the magnetized platelet can retain a higher amount of MNPs without an external magnetic field compared to a setup with no mounted platelet during flushing of the system. However, it's important to note that a higher flow velocity led to lower amounts of accumulated MNPs, and while not statistically significant, the magnetic field strength tended to increase with thicker platelets.","In orthopaedic surgery, accumulation of agents such as anti-infectives in the bone as target tissue is difficult.

In summary, these findings suggest that the MELD and MELDNa models can be generalized to Atlantic Canadian adults with end-stage liver disease awaiting liver transplantation, providing useful information for clinical decision-making and prognostication in this population.","To determine the generalizability of the predictions for 90-day mortality generated by Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) and the serum sodium augmented MELD (MELDNa) to Atlantic Canadian adults with end-stage liver disease awaiting liver transplantation (LT).
The predictive accuracy of the MELD and the MELDNa was evaluated by measurement of the discrimination and calibration of the respective models' estimates for the occurrence of 90-day mortality in a consecutive cohort of LT candidates accrued over a five-year period. Accuracy of discrimination was measured by the area under the ROC curves. Calibration accuracy was evaluated by comparing the observed and model-estimated incidences of 90-day wait-list failure for the total cohort and within quantiles of risk.
The area under the ROC curve for the MELD was 0.887 (95% CI 0.705 to 0.978) - consistent with very good accuracy of discrimination. The area under the ROC curve for the MELDNa was 0.848 (95% CI 0.681 to 0.965). The observed incidence of 90-day wait-list mortality in the validation cohort was 7.9%, which was not significantly different from the MELD estimate of 6.6% (95% CI 4.9% to 8.4%; P=0.177) or the MELDNa estimate of 5.8% (95% CI 3.5% to 8.0%; P=0.065).

The tPMP-susceptible strain showed lower bacteremia rates, smaller vegetations, later onset of valvular regurgitation, better preservation of left ventricular function, less tissue damage, fewer bacterial densities in vegetations and kidneys, and reduced complications such as renal embolization.","Mammalian platelets contain small, cationic, staphylocidal peptides, termed thrombin-induced platelet-microbicidal proteins (tPMPs). Evidence suggests that tPMPs play a key role in host defense against endovascular infections, such as infective endocarditis (IE). In the present study, we evaluated the influence of differences in staphylococcal tPMP-susceptibility profiles in vitro on disease severity in experimental IE.
Experimental IE was induced in rabbits with either a tPMP-susceptible or an isogenic tPMP-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain. Vegetation size, left ventricular fractional shortening, and onset of aortic valvular regurgitation were serially assessed by echocardiography over an 11-day postinfection period. In addition, blood cultures were performed daily. Parameters delineated at autopsy included vegetation weights; bacterial densities in vegetations, myocardium, and kidneys; extent of valvular and perivalvular tissue damage; and renal embolization. The following significant differences were observed in animals infected with the tPMP-susceptible versus the tPMP-resistant S aureus strain: substantially lower bacteremia rates (P=0.02); reduced vegetation growth (P<0.001) and weight (P<0.001); a later onset of aortic valvular regurgitation (P=0.0039); increased preservation of left ventricular function (P<0.001); reduced valvular tissue damage (P=0.01) and perivalvular inflammation (P=0.015); and reduced bacterial densities in vegetations (P<0.001) and kidneys (P<0.01)."

Subjects who died had significantly lower serum 25(OH)D levels (mean 44.8 Â± 24.2 nmol/liter) than those alive at the end of follow-up (51.0 Â± 23.2 nmol/liter), P < 0.001. After adjustment for age, gender, ethnicity, and seasonality, the hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality was 2.02 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.89-2.15] for the lowest serum 25(OH)D quartile (<33.8 nmol/liter) compared with the highest. After further adjustment for comorbidity, use of vitamin D supplements and statins, smoking, socioeconomic status, and body mass index, the HR was 1.81 (95% CI 1.69-1.95). This remained, even after adjustment for serum low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, calcium level (corrected for serum albumin levels), and glomerular filtration rate, 1.85 (95% CI 1.70-2.01). The fully adjusted HR associated with being in the second 25(OH)D quartile (33.8-49.4 nmol/liter) was 1.25 (95% CI 1.16-1.34)."

A 2-way analysis of variance was used to test for statistical significance where the 2 factors were disc location and degeneration. Correlations of composition with degeneration and age were analyzed.
In nondegenerate tissue, elastin by dry weight was on average 2.0% +/- 0.3%, and there were no differences in elastin content among the locations of OAF, IAF, or NP. With degeneration, there was a significant increase in total disc elastin per dry weight at each location.

To measure the site-specific changes in elastin content that accompany disc degeneration using a quantitative, dye-binding assay to assess elastin levels.
Recently, an abundant and organized network of elastic fibers was observed in nondegenerated human disc using immunostaining histochemistry, suggesting a functional role for elastin. While degenerative changes in the disc extracellular matrix composition are well known, changes in elastin content that may accompany degeneration have not been reported.
Human discs were assigned a degenerative grade by 3 independent orthopedic surgeons based on gross morphology.

Usually investigators have used biopsy or a dual sugar absorption test to assess environmental enteropathy. Such tests are time and resource intensive, restricting their utility as screening methods. Serum endotoxin core antibody (EndoCab) concentration is a potential indicator of intestinal inflammation and integrity, and thus may be useful to predict environmental enteropathy. We analyzed the association of serum EndoCab levels versus linear growth and lactulose-mannitol assay results in 2-5 year old rural Malawian children.
This was an observational study of 388 rural, asymptomatic Malawian children who had anthropometric measurements taken at least every 3 months since birth. In June and July 2011, dual sugar permeability tests were performed and serum samples were drawn for EndoCab assays.

The objective of this study was to investigate parent-administered paracetamol in toddlers during a winter-period in relation to symptoms, doctor contacts and severity-rated illness.
The study was conducted as a prospective diary study covering a three-month winter-period. It comprised a cohort of 183 infants born in February 2001 in a district of the capital area in Denmark.
According to the parents, a total of 119 toddlers (65%) received paracetamol at least once during the study period; 9.3% of the toddlers received paracetamol for more than ten days. The administration of paracetamol rose as the number of symptoms increased. Paracetamol was given in 37% of days with fever. The most frequent combinations of symptoms to trigger paracetamol administration were fever and earache with a probability of 64%. For the symptoms of vomiting and earache, the probability was 60%.

To determine perceptions of patients and their families of evidence-based design features in a new heart center.
Hospitalized patients and their families, most of whom were in intensive care and step-down units, were surveyed and data from the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems were reviewed to determine perceptions of evidence-based design features incorporated into a new heart center and to assess patients' satisfaction with the environment. Results Responses were reviewed and categorized descriptively. Five general environment topics of focus emerged: privacy, space, noise, light, and overall atmosphere. Characteristics perceived as being dissatisfying and satisfying are discussed.",Do patients and their families weigh in on evidence-based hospital design?,"Yes. Critical care nurses must be aware of the current need to recognize how much the physical environment influences care delivery and take steps to maximize patients' safety, satisfaction, and quality of care.",PASS,pubmedQA," In this study, hospitalized patients and their families who were primarily in intensive care and step-down units were surveyed to determine their perceptions of evidence-based design features in a new heart center and assess their satisfaction with the environment. The five general environment topics of focus were privacy, space, noise, light, and overall atmosphere. Characteristics perceived as dissatisfying and satisfying for each topic are discussed below:

1. Privacy: Patients and families expressed concerns about lack of privacy in semi-private rooms, shared bathrooms, and limited control over their surroundings. On the other hand, they appreciated having a family member stay overnight and the presence of visual screens to provide privacy when needed.

2. Space: Some patients felt cramped in their rooms, while others appreciated the spaciousness of the overall facility. The availability of storage space for personal belongings was also noted as important.

3. Noise: Patients reported that noise from other patients, staff, and equipment was a significant issue, causing stress and difficulty sleeping. However, they appreciated the use of headphones to listen to music or watch TV without disturbing others.

4. Light: Many patients expressed dissatisfaction with the amount and quality of natural light in their rooms, as well as the brightness of artificial lighting during nighttime hours. On the positive side, they appreciated the ability to adjust room lighting levels.

5. Overall Atmosphere: Patients and families generally felt that the new heart center had a welcoming and calming atmosphere, with modern design elements and artwork contributing positively to their experience. However, they also noted concerns about the sterile appearance of some areas and the lack of personalization in patient rooms.

In summary, this study highlights the importance of considering patients' and families' perceptions when designing evidence-based hospital environments. While there were some dissatisfying aspects related to privacy, space, noise, light, and overall atmosphere, many patients appreciated certain design features that contributed to their satisfaction with the environment. These findings can help guide future hospital design efforts to create more patient-centered spaces that promote healing and wellbeing.","In 2 landmark publications, the Institute of Medicine reported on significant deficiencies in our current health care system.

Rats in group SI were sham injured without fluid resuscitation. Rats in the latter 3 groups were inflicted with 30% TBSA full-thickness scald (referred to as burn below) on the back and intraperitoneally injected with 40 mL/kg balanced salt solution immediately after injury. Rats in groups SH and PPG were respectively intraperitoneally injected with SH (56 Âµmol/kg) and PPG (45 mg/kg) within 1 hour post injury.

Data were processed with logarithmic function, one-way analysis of variance, analysis of variance of factorial design, and SNK-q test.
On each PID, the content of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus in the ceca of each group with burned rats was less than that of group SI (with q values from 4.12 to 20.74, P values below 0.05); while the content of Enterococcus, Enterobacter, and Candida albicans was more than that of group SI (with q values from 2.84 to 68.29, P values below 0.05).

To begin to study the kinetics of channel blockade, we examined the time dependence of macroscopic current inhibition following a hyperpolarizing voltage step. Like glibenclamide, piretanide blockade of CFTR was time and voltage dependent. By contrast, furosemide blockade was voltage dependent, but time independent.

Conversely, deregulation of miR-21 (up-regulation) and miR-133b (down-regulation) was detectable in both gastric and esophageal adenocarcinomas. It was noteworthy that miR-200a was significantly down-regulated in gastric adenocarcinoma samples (P = .04) but was up-regulated in esophageal adenocarcinoma samples (P = .001). In addition, the expression level of miR-146b-5p displayed a strong correlation with the tumor stage of gastric cancer."

The aim of this study was to analyze the associations between diet, body composition, lipids and atheroprotective natural antibodies against phosphorylcholine (anti-PC) in patients with RA.
A total of 80 RA patients (76% women), mean age (standard deviation (SD)) 61.4 (12) years and median disease duration of 6 years, were assessed by food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), fatty acid profile in adipose tissue and whole-body dual energy x ray absorptiometry (DXA). Rheumatoid cachexia was defined as fat free mass index below the 25th percentile and fat mass index above the 50th percentile of a reference population. Blood lipids, oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) and anti-PC levels were determined.

We used a tail withdrawal assay in C57Bl/6 mice to assay the antinociceptive effect of systemically administered opioid agonists with varying selectivity at KOP receptors. Pharmacological and genetic approaches were used to analyse the interactions of the other opioid receptors in modulating KOP-mediated antinociception.
Etorphine, a potent agonist at all four opioid receptors, was not anti-nociceptive in MOP knockout (KO) mice, although etorphine is an efficacious KOP receptor agonist and specific KOP receptor agonists remain analgesic in MOP KO mice. As KOP receptor agonists are aversive, we considered KOP-mediated antinociception might be a form of stress-induced analgesia that is blocked by the anxiolytic effects of DOP receptor agonists. In support of this hypothesis, pretreatment with the DOP antagonist, naltrindole (10â€‰mgÂ·kg(-1) ), unmasked etorphine (3â€‰mgÂ·kg(-1) ) antinociception in MOP KO mice. Further, in wild-type mice, KOP-mediated antinociception by systemic U50,488H (10â€‰mgÂ·kg(-1) ) was blocked by pretreatment with the DOP agonist SNC80 (5â€‰mgÂ·kg(-1) ) and diazepam (1â€‰mgÂ·kg(-1) )."
1269,25216916,"Human bitter taste receptors are encoded by a gene family consisting of 25 functional TAS2R loci. In addition, humans carry 11 TAS2R pseudogenes, some of which display evidence for substantial diversification among species, showing lineage-specific loss of function. Since bitter taste is thought to help prevent the intake of toxic substances, diversity at TAS2R genes could reflect the action of natural selection on the ability to recognize some bitter compounds rather than others. Whether species-specific variation in TAS2R pseudogenes is solely the result of genetic drift or whether it may have been influenced by selection due to different feeding behaviors has been an open question.
In this study, we analyzed patterns of variation at human TAS2R pseudogenes in both African and non-African populations, and compared them to those observable in nonhuman primates and archaic human species. Our results showed a similar worldwide distribution of allelic variation for most of the pseudogenes, with the exception of the TAS2R6P and TAS2R18P loci, both of which presented an unexpected higher frequency of derived alleles outside Africa. At the TAS2R6P locus, two SNPs were found in strong linkage disequilibrium (r2â€‰>â€‰0.9) with variants in the functional TAS2R5 gene, which showed signatures of selection. The human TAS2R18P carried a species-specific stop-codon upstream of four polymorphic insertions in the reading frame. SNPs at this locus showed significant positive values in a number of neutrality statistics, and age estimates indicated that they arose after the homo-chimp divergence.",Does genetic variation in taste receptor pseudogenes provide evidence for a dynamic role in human evolution?,"Yes. The similar distribution of variation of many human bitter receptor pseudogenes among human populations suggests that they arose from the ancestral forms by a unidirectional loss of function. However we explain the higher frequency of TAS2R6P derived alleles outside Africa as the effect of the balancing selection acting on the closely linked TAS2R5 gene. In contrast, TAS2R18P displayed a more complex history, suggesting an acquired function followed by a recent pseudogenization that predated the divergence of human modern and archaic species, which we hypothesize was associated with adaptions to dietary changes.",PASS,pubmedQA," Yes, the study provides evidence for a dynamic role in human evolution as it shows that variation in certain TAS2R pseudogenes (specifically TAS2R6P and TAS2R18P) is not solely due to genetic drift but may have been influenced by selection. This is suggested by the findings of derived alleles outside Africa, linkage disequilibrium with variants in the functional TAS2R5 gene, signatures of selection, and significant positive values in neutrality statistics for the human TAS2R18P locus. Furthermore, the species-specific stop-codon and polymorphic insertions in the reading frame of TAS2R18P, along with its post-divergence age estimate, further support this conclusion.","Human bitter taste receptors are encoded by a gene family consisting of 25 functional TAS2R loci.

1270,9551677,"Whether mutations in the putative haemochromatosis gene (HFE) and hepatitis C virus act independently to precipitate porphyria cutanea tarda is unknown. The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between mutations in HFE, hepatitis C and porphyria cutanea tarda.
The frequencies of the C282Y and H63D mutations in HFE were determined in 27 patients with porphyria cutanea tarda and compared with the reported control frequencies. In addition, the presence of hepatitis C virus infection was identified and related to the patients' HFE status.
The C282Y mutation was found in 44.4% of patients compared with the control frequency of 12% (p<0.001). Three patients were homozygous for the C282Y mutation, two of whom did not meet current clinical diagnostic criteria for expressed haemochromatosis. The proportion of patients with the H63D mutation did not differ from the reported control frequency. The mean transferrin saturation and serum ferritin concentration were similar in porphyria cutanea tarda patients who were homozygous normal and heterozygous for the C282Y mutation, but greater in both groups than previously reported in healthy controls. Seven (25.9%) patients were anti-HCV IgG positive. None of these patients carried the C282Y mutation. Porphyria cutanea tarda patients heterozygous for the C282Y mutation and patients with anti-HCV antibodies had elevated transferrin saturations and serum ferritin concentrations.",Are the C282Y mutation in the haemochromatosis gene ( HFE ) and hepatitis C virus infection independent cofactors for porphyria cutanea tarda in Australian patients?,"Yes. The raised frequency of the C282Y mutation in porphyria cutanea tarda indicates that this mutation is likely to be a predisposing factor. However, abnormalities of iron indices also exist in porphyria cutanea tarda patients without mutations in HFE. Hepatitis C virus infection is likely to be another common precipitating factor for porphyria cutanea tarda which acts independently of the C282Y mutation.",PASS,pubmedQA," Yes, the study suggests that the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene is a significant cofactor for porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) in Australian patients. The frequency of this mutation was significantly higher in PCT patients compared to controls (44.4% vs 12%, p<0.001). However, it's important to note that two out of the three homozygous C282Y mutation carriers did not meet current clinical diagnostic criteria for hemochromatosis.

The study also found that hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection was present in 25.9% of PCT patients, but none of these patients carried the C282Y mutation. This suggests that HCV infection may not act independently as a cofactor for PCT in this population.

In terms of biochemical markers, both groups (homozygous normal and heterozygous for the C282Y mutation) had higher mean transferrin saturation and serum ferritin concentrations than healthy controls, but these values were similar within the PCT group.

In conclusion, while both the C282Y mutation in HFE and HCV infection can contribute to the development of PCT, they seem to act independently in this Australian patient population. However, further studies are needed to confirm these findings and explore potential interactions between these factors.","Whether mutations in the putative haemochromatosis gene (HFE) and hepatitis C virus act independently to precipitate porphyria cutanea tarda is unknown.

During 1 year, the benefits of IFX/AZA would outweigh the risks, unless serious infections occurred in 20% or more of the population or lymphoma in 3.9% or more. These thresholds are 5-fold and 65-fold higher than base-case estimates, respectively."
1278,16483579,"To investigate whether serum gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) is an independent predictor for incident coronary events in initially healthy men from the general population.
The study was based on 1878 men (aged 25-64 years) who participated in the first MONICA Augsburg survey 1984/1985, and who were free of coronary heart disease at baseline. Up to 2002 a total of 150 incident acute coronary events occurred. Baseline levels of GGT were higher in men who experienced an event than in event-free men (28.4+/-2.0 units/l versus 22.4+/-2.1 units/l, p 0.0002).

In a Cox proportional hazards model after age adjustment hazard ratios (HR) for incident myocardial infarction across GGT quartiles (<13, 13 to <20, 20 to <35, and >/=35 units/l) were 1.0, 1.84, 2.02, and 3.08 (p for trend 0.0001). Further adjustment for hypertension, TC/HDL ratio, diabetes, smoking, physical activity, alcohol intake, education years and BMI attenuated the association; comparing the highest versus lowest quartile of GGT the HR for a first-ever coronary event was then 2.34 (95% CI, 1.23-4.44).",Is serum gamma-glutamyltransferase a predictor of incident coronary events in apparently healthy men from the general population?,"Yes.

Fifty-seven consecutive patients (30 male, 27 female; mean age, 58.6 +/- 15.7 y) were enrolled in the study. After intravenous injection of 7.77 MBq (0.21 mCi) of (18)F-FDG per kilogram, a standard whole-body CT study (80-110 s) and PET emission scan were acquired for 4 min/bed position in 49 patients and 3 min/bed position in 8 patients. One-minute-per-bed-position data were then extracted from the 3- or 4-min/bed position scans to reconstruct single-minute/bed position scans for each patient. Patients were subgrouped according to weight as follows: <59 kg (<130 lb; n = 15), 59-81 kg (130-179 lb; n = 33), and >or=82 kg (>or=180 lb; n = 9). Three experienced observers recorded numbers and locations of lesion by consensus and independently rated image quality as good, moderate, poor, or nondiagnostic.
The observers analyzed 220 reconstructed whole-body PET images from 57 patients. They identified 114 lesions ranging in size from 0.7 to 7.0 cm on the 3- (n = 8) and 4-min/bed position images (n = 49). Of these, only 4 were missed on the 1-min/bed position scans, and all lesions were identified on the corresponding 2-min/bed position images.

LSO PET detector technology permits fast 3D imaging protocols whereby weight-based emission scan durations ranging from 1 to 3 min/bed position provide similar lesion detectability when compared with 4-min/bed position images.,PASS,pubmedQA," Yes, both patient weight and emission scan duration can impact PET/CT image quality and lesion detectability. In this study, it was found that using a fast PET/CT imaging protocol with lutetium oxyorthosilicate (LSO) detector technology and 3-dimensional (3D) image-acquisition protocols, reducing the emission scan duration from 4 minutes to 1 or 2 minutes per bed position can lead to a decrease in image quality compared to the 4-minute scans. However, it was also noted that all lesions were identified on the corresponding 2-min/bed position images, and only 4 were missed on the 1-min/bed position scans.

Additionally, the study found that patient weight can also impact image quality. The observers in this study subgrouped patients according to weight as follows: <59 kg (<130 lb), 59-81 kg (130-179 lb), and >or=82 kg (>or=180 lb). It was found that image quality differed significantly from the reference 4-min/bed position images for both 1- and 2-min/bed position scans, but the difference was more pronounced in heavier patients. This suggests that heavier patients may require longer scan durations to achieve comparable image quality to lighter patients.

Overall, this study demonstrates that fast PET/CT imaging protocols can be effective for reducing scan times while maintaining lesion detectability, but image quality may be compromised in some cases, particularly in heavier patients.

1286,21039404,"Serum and IgG isolated from patients with the autoimmune blistering disease pemphigus vulgaris (PV) trigger complex intracellular pathways in keratinocytes, including alterations of the cell cycle and metabolism, which ultimately lead to cell-cell detachment (acantholysis).

In the present study we investigated in more detail the role of PERK in the pathogenesis of PV.
PERK levels were assessed by Western blotting and in-cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and PERK expression was silenced by siRNA technology. The effects of PV sera/IgG on keratinocyte cultures were investigated by flow cytometry, MTT and adhesion assays.
We show that PERK is activated in keratinocytes exposed to PV serum, as demonstrated by an increase in phosphorylated PERK levels and phosphorylation of eIF2Î±. Decreased expression of PERK by siRNA reduced the effects of PV serum on the cell cycle and keratinocyte viability, two key events in PV pathophysiology. As impairment of metabolic activity in PV is partially due to non-IgG serum factors, we then investigated the activation of PERK in keratinocytes incubated with whole PV serum, purified PV IgG and IgG-depleted PV serum. The data demonstrated that PV sera depleted of IgG, but not PV IgG, triggered PERK phosphorylation and this correlated with a marked reduction of metabolic activity in keratinocytes exposed to IgG-free serum. Knockdown of PERK by siRNA abrogated the changes in the cell cycle and apoptosis induced by IgG-depleted PV serum.

We show that PERK is activated in keratinocytes exposed to PV serum, as demonstrated by an increase in phosphorylated PERK levels and phosphorylation of eIF2Î±. Decreased expression of PERK by siRNA reduced the effects of PV serum on the cell cycle and keratinocyte viability, two key events in PV pathophysiology. As impairment of metabolic activity in PV is partially due to non-IgG serum factors, we then investigated the activation of PERK in keratinocytes incubated with whole PV serum, purified PV IgG and IgG-depleted PV serum. The data demonstrated that PV sera depleted of IgG, but not PV IgG, triggered PERK phosphorylation and this correlated with a marked reduction of metabolic activity in keratinocytes exposed to IgG-free serum. Knockdown of PERK by siRNA abrogated the changes in the cell cycle and apoptosis induced by IgG-depleted PV serum. Finally, the reduction of metabolic activity observed in keratinocytes exposed to IgG-depleted PV serum was almost absent in PERK-deficient cells."

Plasma samples from 17 highly exposed VC workers without liver cancer and 27 unexposed healthy volunteers were obtained for metabolite extraction and GC/MS and LC/MS
613 unique named metabolites were identified. Of these, 189 metabolites were increased in the VC exposure group while 94 metabolites were decreased. Random Forest analysis indicated that the metabolite signature could separate the groups with 94% accuracy.

However, it's important to note that the sample size is small and more research with larger populations may be needed to confirm these findings.","Primary hyperoxaluria-I (PH-I) is a serious metabolic disease resulting in end-stage renal disease. Pre-emptive liver transplantation (PLT) for PH-I is an option for children with early diagnosis. There is still little information on its effect on long-term renal function in this situation.
Long-term assessment of renal function was conducted using Schwartz's formula (estimated glomerular filtration rate-eGFR) in four children (Group A) undergoing PLT between 2002 and 2008, and a comparison was done with eight gender- and sex-matched controls (Group B) having liver transplantation for other indications.
All patients received a liver graft from a deceased donor. Median follow-up for the two groups was 64 and 94 months, respectively. One child in Group A underwent re-transplantation due to hepatic artery thrombosis, while acute rejection was seen in one. A significant difference was seen in eGFR at transplant (81 vs 148 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) with greater functional impairment seen in the study population. In Group A, renal function reduced by 21 and 11% compared with 37 and 35% in Group B at 12 and 24 months, respectively. At 2 years post-transplantation, there was no significant difference in eGFR between the two groups (72 vs 100 mL/min/1.73 m(2), respectively; P = 0.06)."

We used DamID-seq to examine the genome-wide binding patterns of Dichaete and SoxNeuro in four species of Drosophila. Through a quantitative comparison of Dichaete binding, we evaluated the rate of binding site turnover across the genome as well as at specific functional sites. We also examined the presence of Sox motifs within binding intervals and the correlation between sequence conservation and binding conservation.

We find that, while the regulatory networks driven by Dichaete and SoxNeuro are largely conserved across the drosophilids studied, binding site turnover is widespread and correlated with phylogenetic distance. Nonetheless, binding is preferentially conserved at known cis-regulatory modules and core, independently verified binding sites. We observed the strongest binding conservation at sites that are commonly bound by Dichaete and SoxNeuro, suggesting that these sites are functionally important.

Among all MMPs studied, only staining for MMP-26 was significantly more intense in cancer cells of the post-transplant group compared with the IC group (p = 0.01), whereas MMP-9 expression was more abundant in stromal macrophages surrounding SCCs of IC patients (p = 0.02). MMP-26 expression in cancer cells (p = 0.04) and that of MMP-9 in neutrophils (p = 0.005) were more abundant in SCCs of patients using cyclosporine."

We identified and subcloned the genes coding for putative deoxyribonucleoside kinases in Escherichia coli, Pasteurella multocida, Salmonella enterica, Yersinia enterocolitica, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens and Listeria monocytogenes.

Kv3 channels have specialized gating properties that facilitate high-frequency, repetitive firing in fast-spiking neurons. Mutations in human Kv3.3 cause spinocerebellar ataxia type 13 (SCA13), an autosomal dominant genetic disease that exists in distinct neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative forms. To assess the potential usefulness of the zebrafish as a model system for SCA13, we have characterized the functional properties of zebrafish Kv3.3 channels with and without mutations analogous to those that cause SCA13.

The biological activity of NGR-hPK5 was assessed and compared with that of wild-type hPK5, in vitro and in vivo. NGR-hPK5 showed more potent antiangiogenic activity than wild-type hPK5: the former had a stronger inhibitory effect on proliferation, migration and cord formation of vascular endothelial cells, and produced a stronger antiangiogenic response in the CAM assay.

Quantitative angiographic assessment showed that the mean diameter of the RA coronary grafts was significantly larger than that of the in situ RA and of the ITA (2.89+/-0.40 mm RA grafts, 2.14+/-0.52 mm in situ RA, 2.25+/-0.53 mm ITA grafts; P<0.001). The in situ RA demonstrated a typical muscular architecture, whereas RA coronary grafts showed a clear reduction of the thickness of the medial layer and had a less well-defined muscular component of the media with interposition of elastic tissue. Serotonin endovascular infusion elicited a strong spastic reaction in in situ RAs; the same challenge induced only moderate constriction in RA and ITA coronary grafts."

Defining an ""immediate virological response (IVR)"" as the loss of serum hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA 7 d after the first administration of PEG-IFN alpha, we conducted a 12-wk course of PEG-IFN alpha2a monotherapy without the addition of ribavirin for 38 patients who had low pretreatment HCV RNA load and exhibited IVR. The patients included 21 men and 17 women, whose ages ranged from 22 to 77 years (mean +/- SD: 52.0 +/- 17.8 years). There were 4 patients with HCV genotype 1b, 23 patients with genotype 2a and 4 patients with genotype 2b. HCV genotype was not determined for the remaining 7 patients. Patients were categorized into a sustained virological response (SVR) group, if serum HCV RNA remained negative for 24 wk after the end of treatment, or into a relapse group.

Interactions of Group (RAN, CW) Ã— Visit (hunger, satiety) revealed that, for the CW group, hunger significantly increased activation in reward salience circuitry (ventral striatum, dorsal caudate, anterior cingulate cortex) during processing of immediate reward, whereas satiety increased activation in cognitive control circuitry (ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, insula) during decision making. In contrast, brain response in reward and cognitive neurocircuitry did not differ during hunger and satiety in the RAN group. A main effect of group revealed elevated response in the middle frontal gyrus for the RAN group compared with the CW group.",Does hunger motivate reward in women remitted from anorexia nervosa?,No. Women remitted from AN failed to increase activation of reward valuation circuitry when hungry and showed elevated response in cognitive control circuitry independent of metabolic state. Decreased sensitivity to the motivational drive of hunger may explain the ability of individuals with AN to restrict food when emaciated. Difficulties in valuating emotional salience may contribute to inabilities to appreciate the risks inherent in this disorder.,PASS,pubmedQA," The study suggests that in women remitted from anorexia nervosa (RAN), hunger does not significantly enhance sensitivity to immediate rewards as it does in healthy comparison women (CW). This is indicated by the lack of difference in brain response in reward and cognitive neurocircuitry during hunger and satiety in the RAN group, unlike in the CW group where hunger increased activation in reward salience circuitry. However, there was a main effect of group showing elevated response in the middle frontal gyrus for the RAN group compared with the CW group. This could imply that despite being remitted from anorexia nervosa, these women may still exhibit different brain activity patterns compared to healthy individuals when it comes to processing rewards.","Hunger enhances sensitivity to reward, yet individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN) are not motivated to eat when starved. This study investigated brain response to rewards during hunger and satiated states to examine whether diminished response to reward could underlie food restriction in AN.

1334,15922431,"To determine whether use of the digital rectal examination (DRE) results in decreased participation in prostate cancer (PCa) screening, which, in turn, would result in lower detection. Population-based PCa screening includes prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurement with or without a DRE. PSA and DRE screening provide greater sensitivity than PSA alone; however, the increased participation rate resulting from PSA-alone screening may result in a greater detection rate.
We performed a survey of 13,580 healthy men undergoing PSA-only population-based screening. In addition to the basic demographic information, the survey asked whether the participant would still be willing to participate in the screening if it included a DRE. We modeled the willingness to participate to assess the effect of PSA screening versus PSA and DRE screening on the basis of previously published data and our results.
The results of our study indicated that only 78% of men would participate in screening that included both DRE and PSA. Thus, 7800 men of a theoretical population of 10,000 would participate in a screening that included both DRE and PSA. The positive screen rate (PSA > or = 4.0 ng/mL and/or abnormal DRE) would then have been 2013, with 472 PCa cases and 1540 negative biopsies. In the PSA-alone arm, all 10,000 men would have agreed to participate, and the positive screen rate (PSA > or = 4.0 ng/mL) would have been 1480, with 499 PCa cases and 980 negative biopsies. The PSA-alone arm would thus have detected 27 more cancers and performed 560 fewer negative biopsies.",Is digital rectal examination barrier to population-based prostate cancer screening?,"Yes. The results of our study have demonstrated that DRE is a significant barrier to participation in PCa screening. PSA plus DRE-based programs result in fewer cases of PCa detected, with a significant increase in negative biopsies. We, therefore, suggest that future mass screening efforts include only PSA determination and omit the DRE.",PASS,pubmedQA," Based on the data provided in your study, it appears that the inclusion of a digital rectal examination (DRE) in population-based prostate cancer screening may decrease participation rates by approximately 22%. This would result in a lower detection rate for prostate cancer compared to PSA-only screening. Specifically, in a theoretical population of 10,000 men, the number of positive screens (PSA > or = 4.0 ng/mL and/or abnormal DRE) would be 2013 with both PSA and DRE, compared to 1480 with only PSA. This means that 27 more cases of prostate cancer would be detected in the PSA-only arm, while 560 fewer negative biopsies would be performed. However, it's important to note that this is a theoretical scenario and actual results may vary depending on various factors such as population characteristics, cultural attitudes towards medical examinations, and other confounding variables.

1336,23800339,"We addressed the question whether live-virus challenges could alter vaccine-induced antibody (Ab) responses in vaccinated rhesus macaques (RMs) that completely resisted repeated exposures to R5-tropic simian-human immunodeficiency viruses encoding heterologous HIV clade C envelopes (SHIV-Cs).
We examined the Ab responses in aviremic RMs that had been immunized with a multi-component protein vaccine (multimeric HIV-1 gp160, HIV-1 Tat and SIV Gag-Pol particles) and compared anti-Env plasma Ab titers before and after repeated live-virus exposures. Although no viremia was ever detected in these animals, they showed significant increases in anti-gp140 Ab titers after they had encountered live SHIVs. When we investigated the dynamics of anti-Env Ab titers during the immunization and challenge phases further, we detected the expected, vaccine-induced increases of Ab responses about two weeks after the last protein immunization. Remarkably, these titers kept rising during the repeated virus challenges, although no viremia resulted. In contrast, in vaccinated RMs that were not exposed to virus, anti-gp140 Ab titers declined after the peak seen two weeks after the last immunization.

1343,15297829,"The cause of the coagulopathy seen with supraceliac aortic cross-clamping (SC AXC) is unclear. SC AXC for 30 minutes results in both clotting factor consumption and activation of fibrinolytic pathways. This study was undertaken to define the hemostatic alterations that occur with longer intervals of SC AXC.
Seven pigs underwent SC AXC for 60 minutes. Five pigs that underwent infrarenal aortic cross-clamping (IR AXC) for 60 minutes and 11 pigs that underwent SC AXC for 30 minutes served as controls. No heparin was used. Blood samples were drawn at baseline, 5 minutes before release of the aortic clamp, and 5, 30, and 60 minutes after unclamping. Prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, platelet count, and fibrinogen concentration were measured as basic tests of hemostatic function. Thrombin-antithrombin complexes were used to detect the presence of intravascular thrombosis. Fibrinolytic pathway activation was assessed with levels of tissue plasminogen activator antigen and tissue plasminogen activator activity, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activity, and alpha2-antiplasmin activity. Statistical analysis was performed with the Student t test and repeated measures of analysis of variance.
Prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet count did not differ between groups at any time. Fibrinogen concentration decreased 5 minutes (P =.005) and 30 minutes (P =.006) after unclamping in both SC AXC groups, but did not change in the IR AXC group.

Experimental re-expression of MS4A3 in an EVI1 overexpressing cell line counteracted the tumor promoting effect of EVI1 in a murine xenograft model by increasing the rate of apoptosis."
1362,24836459,"Pathogenesis of early-onset preeclampsia (PE) is generally recognized by impaired trophoblast invasion of the myometrial arteries, which results in placental insufficiency. Recently, we reported that CDX1 is hypermethylated in the human preeclampsia placenta. However, whether CDX1 participates in trophoblast invasion has not been clearly elucidated.
We investigated the function of CDX1 in the extravillous trophoblast cell line HTR-8/SVneo using stable transfection of CDX1. Using a CDX1 stable transfected cell line, we determined the cell invasion using a QCM ECMatrix 24-well kit. The cell viability was detected using an MTT (3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. Quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting analyses were performed to examine the changes in the expression of downstream target genes and proteins. To disrupt PI3K/AKT signaling, we used the PI3K inhibitor perifosine.
Cell invasion assays demonstrated that CDX1 restricts trophoblast cell invasiveness. In contrast, quantification of cumulative cell numbers revealed that CDX1 did not affect cell proliferation. Western blotting analysis and quantitative real time PCR demonstrated that MMP-9 expression was reduced, whereas TIMP-1 expression was increased in CDX1-overexpressed cells. However, overexpression of CDX1 did not affect PI3K/AKT signaling in HTR-8/SVneo trophoblast cells. In contrast, CDX1 was regulated by the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.",Does cDX1 restrict the invasion of HTR-8/SVneo trophoblast cells by inhibiting MMP-9 expression?,"Yes. Altogether, we found that in trophoblast cells, CDX1 reduced invasion independently of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Furthermore, CDX1 functions in concert with PI3K/AKT signaling to regulate trophoblast invasion. We concluded that CDX1 restricts the invasion of HTR-8/SVneo trophoblast cells by inhibiting MMP-9 expression independently of the PI3K/AKT pathway.",PASS,pubmedQA," Yes, based on the provided context, it appears that cDX1 does restrict the invasion of HTR-8/SVneo trophoblast cells, as demonstrated in the cell invasion assays.

Interestingly, miR-200c was commonly downregulated in ccRCC specimens and ccRCC cell lines with significant functional consequences. Growth curve and FACS assay indicated that overexpression of miR-200c suppressed cell growth and induced cell-cycle arrest at G0-G1 phases in SN12-PM6 and 786-O cells. Furthermore, miR-200c could suppress in vivo tumor growth of SN12-PM6 cells in mice. Bioinformatics exposed cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) as a potential target of miR-200c, which was validated using a luciferase reporter assay. Mechanistic investigations revealed that miR-200c was directly responsible for suppressing the expression of CDK2 in ccRCC cell lines and xenografts. Taken together, miR-200c plays an antioncogenic role in ccRCC, through controlling cell growth and cell-cycle progression by downregulating the G1-S regulator CDK2."

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been implicated in VSMC differentiation, but the responsible sources are unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of Nox1 and Nox4-derived ROS in this process.
Primary VSMCs were used to study the relationship between Nox homologues and differentiation markers such as smooth muscle alpha-actin (SM alpha-actin), smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SM-MHC), heavy caldesmon, and calponin. We found that Nox4 and differentiation marker genes were downregulated from passage 1 to passage 6 to 12, whereas Nox1 was gradually upregulated. Nox4 co-localized with SM alpha-actin-based stress fibers in differentiated VSMC, and moved into focal adhesions in de-differentiated cells. siRNA against nox4 reduced NADPH-driven superoxide production in serum-deprived VSMCs and downregulated SM-alpha actin, SM-MHC, and calponin, as well as SM-alpha actin stress fibers. Nox1 depletion did not decrease these parameters.",Is nox4 required for maintenance of the differentiated vascular smooth muscle cell phenotype?,Yes.

Av.Cr which tested positive for alkaloids, coumarins, flavonoids, saponins, sterols, tannins and terpenes caused concentration-dependent (0.03-10mg/mL) relaxation of jejunum spontaneous contractions. Av.Cr inhibited the carbachol (CCh, 1 microM) and K(+) (80 mM)-induced contractions in a pattern, similar to that of dicyclomine. Av.Cr shifted the Ca(2+) concentration-response curves to right, like that caused by verapamil and dicyclomine. Av.Cr produced rightward parallel shift in CCh-curves, followed by non-parallel shift at higher concentration with the suppression of the maximum response, similar to that caused by dicyclomine.

1. Av.Cr caused concentration-dependent relaxation of jejunum spontaneous contractions, similar to dicyclomine, an antispasmodic drug that blocks muscarinic receptors.
2. Av.Cr inhibited carbachol (CCh, a muscarinic agonist) and K+ (potassium ion)-induced contractions in a pattern similar to dicyclomine.
3. Av.Cr shifted the Ca2+ concentration-response curves to the right, like verapamil and dicyclomine, suggesting inhibition of calcium influx.
4. Av.Cr produced a rightward parallel shift in CCh-curves followed by non-parallel shift at higher concentrations with suppression of the maximum response, similar to dicyclomine's effect.
5. Av.Cr exhibited protective effects against castor oil-induced diarrhea and CCh-mediated bronchoconstriction in rodents, indicating antispasmodic and bronchodilatory activities.
6.

Five different human squamous cell carcinoma cell lines (SiHa, FaDuDD, UTSCC5, UTSCC14 and UTSCC15) were treated with hypoxia, acidosis (pH 6.3), or a combination, and gene expression analyzed using microarray. SiHa and FaDuDD were chosen for further characterization of cell energetics and protein synthesis. Total cellular ATP turnover and relative glycolytic dependency was determined by simultaneous measurements of oxygen consumption and lactate synthesis rates and total protein synthesis was determined by autoradiographic quantification of the incorporation of 35S-labelled methionine and cysteine into protein.

The reported effectiveness of MSBPs was based on the results of a single-center randomized controlled trial by Raad et al and the majority of the patients (99%) in the study were chemotherapy outpatients.
Between March 14, 2004 and December 28, 2006, the patients scheduled for CVC insertion in surgical units at 9 medical centers in Japan were randomly assigned to either an MSBP group (n = 211) or a standard sterile barrier precaution (SSBP) group (n = 213). This study was registered in the UMIN Clinical Trials Registry (registration ID number: UMIN000001400).
The median (range) duration of catheterization was 14 days (0-92 days) in the MSBP group and 14 days (0-112 days) in the SSBP group. There were 5 cases (2.4%) of CRBSI in the MSBP group and 6 cases (2.8%) in the SSBP group (relative risk, 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.26-2.7; P = 0.77). The rate of CRBSIs per 1000 catheter days was 1.5 in the MSBP group and 1.6 in the SSBP group.

From July 2000 to September 2003, 27 newly diagnosed penile carcinoma patients (T1, T2, N0) were included in this prospective study. The isolated gamma probe technique uses the sodium phytate technetium as a tracer and inguinal scanning with probe and after identified the lymph node it is removed. Lymphadenectomies were performed for positive inguinal lymph nodes metastasis.
There were 27 patients (mean age 59.6). Follow up was 37 months. Patients from country were 72% and illiterate or semi-illiterate were 56.7%. The tumors were mostly located in the glans (81.4%).

This raises the possibility that astrocytes contribute to the regulation of extracellular t-PA levels in the CNS.",PASS,pubmedQA," Yes, the study found that retinoids and activation of PKC (specifically with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or PMA) induce tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) expression and storage in human astrocytes. Additionally, the study also demonstrated that t-PA is stored in intracellular granular structures within these cells and can be released in a regulated manner upon stimulation with forskolin or histamine. Furthermore, the presence of t-PA was confirmed in reactive astrocytes in human brain tissue.","Emerging data demonstrate important roles for tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) in the central nervous system (CNS). In contrast to endothelial cells, little is known about the regulation of t-PA gene expression and secretion in astrocytes.
The aims of the present study were to investigate whether t-PA gene expression is regulated by retinoids and the protein kinase C (PKC) activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) in human astrocytes, and to study whether t-PA is stored and subject to regulated release from these cells, as with endothelial cells.
Native human astrocytes were treated with RA and/or PMA. mRNA was quantified by real-time RT-PCR and protein secretion determined by ELISA. Intracellular t-PA immunoreactivity in astrocytes was examined by immunocyto- and histochemistry.
RA and/or PMA induced a time-dependent increase in t-PA mRNA and protein levels in astrocytes, reaching 10-fold after combined treatment. This was associated with increased amounts of t-PA storage in intracellular granular structures. Both forskolin and histamine induced regulated release of t-PA. The presence of t-PA in reactive astrocytes was confirmed in human brain tissue."

HDAC expression in seven pancreatic cancer cell lines and normal human pancreatic ductal epithelial cells was determined by Western blotting. Antitumor interactions between class I- and class II-selective HDACIs were determined by MTT assays and standard isobologram/CompuSyn software analyses. The effects of HDACIs on cell death, apoptosis and cell cycle progression, and histone H4, alpha-tubulin, p21, and Î³H2AX levels were determined by colony formation assays, flow cytometry analysis, and Western blotting, respectively.
The majority of classes I and II HDACs were detected in the pancreatic cancer cell lines, albeit at variable levels. Treatments with MGCD0103 (a class I-selective HDACI) resulted in dose-dependent growth arrest, cell death/apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase, accompanied by induction of p21 and DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). In contrast, MC1568 (a class IIa-selective HDACI) or Tubastatin A (a HDAC6-selective inhibitor) showed minimal effects.

Treatments with MGCD0103 (a class I-selective HDACI) resulted in dose-dependent growth arrest, cell death/apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase, accompanied by induction of p21 and DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). In contrast, MC1568 (a class IIa-selective HDACI) or Tubastatin A (a HDAC6-selective inhibitor) showed minimal effects. When combined simultaneously, MC1568 significantly enhanced MGCD0103-induced growth arrest, cell death/apoptosis, and G2/M cell cycle arrest, while Tubastatin A only synergistically enhanced MGCD0103-induced growth arrest. Although MC1568 or Tubastatin A alone had no obvious effects on DNA DSBs and p21 expression, their combination with MGCD0103 resulted in cooperative induction of p21 in the cells."

In this study, we investigated a new physiologic approach that consists of coinjecting motogenic factors insulin growth factor (IGF)-1 or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) to enhance the migration of human skeletal myoblasts. Among the different ways by which those factors can induce the cell migration processes, we investigated their capacity to enhance cell endogenous proteolytic activity that will help transplanted cells to migrate through the extracellular matrix.
In vitro, myoblasts were coincubated with bFGF or IGF-1.

Cell line study.
Tumor cell growth with the chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin was measured in the presence or absence of HA, anti-CD44 antibody plus HA, and other inhibitors of the PLC-mediated Ca2+ signaling pathway. Ca2+ mobilization was measured with fluorescence spectrophotometry using the Ca2+ binding dye Fura/2AM.
In the absence of HA, cisplatin inhibited tumor cell growth. The addition of HA, but not HA plus anti-CD44 antibody, resulted in a 5-fold reduced ability of cisplatin to cause HNSCC cell death, suggesting that HA can promote CD44-dependent cisplatin resistance. Fluorescence spectrophotometry demonstrated that HA can promote CD44-dependent Ca2+ mobilization in HNSCC.

In particular, HA-CD44 promotion of PLC-mediated Ca2+ signaling plays a role in cisplatin resistance in HNSCC cells. Perturbation of this HA-CD44-mediated signaling pathway may be a promising target to overcome cisplatin resistance in HNSCC.",PASS,pubmedQA," Yes, the study suggests that hyaluronan (HA)-CD44 promotes head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cisplatin resistance. This is achieved through HA's promotion of CD44-dependent phospholipase C (PLC)-mediated Ca2+ signaling, which in turn alters the sensitivity of HNSCC cells to cisplatin. The inhibition of PLC and the inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate receptor eliminated HA-mediated Ca2+ mobilization and HA-mediated cisplatin resistance in these cell lines.","To investigate whether hyaluronan (HA)-CD44 promotes head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cisplatin resistance and whether HA-CD44 promotes phospholipase C (PLC)-mediated Ca2+ signaling to alter cisplatin sensitivity in HNSCC.
Cell line study.
Tumor cell growth with the chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin was measured in the presence or absence of HA, anti-CD44 antibody plus HA, and other inhibitors of the PLC-mediated Ca2+ signaling pathway. Ca2+ mobilization was measured with fluorescence spectrophotometry using the Ca2+ binding dye Fura/2AM.
In the absence of HA, cisplatin inhibited tumor cell growth. The addition of HA, but not HA plus anti-CD44 antibody, resulted in a 5-fold reduced ability of cisplatin to cause HNSCC cell death, suggesting that HA can promote CD44-dependent cisplatin resistance. Fluorescence spectrophotometry demonstrated that HA can promote CD44-dependent Ca2+ mobilization in HNSCC. On the other hand, the presence of U73122, a PLC inhibitor, and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, an inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate receptor inhibitor, eliminated HA-mediated Ca2+ mobilization and HA-mediated cisplatin resistance in these cell lines."

In this study, we explored the contribution of six GRIN2B markers to DD and key DD-related phenotypes by association analyses in a sample of Italian nuclear families. Moreover, we assessed potential gene-by-environment interactions on DD-related phenotypes.
We carried out a family-based association study to determine whether the GRIN2B gene influences both DD as a categorical trait and its related cognitive traits in a large cohort of 466 Italian nuclear families ascertained through a proband affected by DD. Moreover, we tested the role of the selected GRIN2B markers and a set of commonly described environmental moderators using a test for GÃ—E interaction in sib pair-based association analysis of quantitative traits in 178 Italian nuclear families.

PAPC influences cell-cell adhesion mediated by C-Cadherin. A putative direct adhesion activity of PAPC is discussed.

In these processes the signaling function of PAPC in activating RhoA/JNK and supporting Wnt-11/PCP by binding to frizzled 7 (fz7) is important.
Here we demonstrate by loss of function experiments in Xenopus embryos that PAPC regulates another type of morphogenetic movement, the invagination of the ear placode. Knockdown of PAPC by antisense morpholinos results in deformation of the otic vesicle without altering otocyst marker expression. Depletion of PAPC could be rescued by full-length PAPC, constitutive active RhoA and by the closely related PCNS but not by classical cadherins.

While experimental studies have advanced a protective role of carnosine for diabetic complications, a link between carnosine, TGF-Î² and matrix accumulation remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that L-carnosine inhibits TGF-Î² production and signalling, thereby reducing hyperglycaemia-associated ECM accumulation.
Human mesangial cells (MC) were cultured in high-glucose (HG, 25 mM D-glucose) medium alone or in HG medium to which 20 mM L-carnosine was added. Collagen VI (Col6) and fibronectin (FN) deposition and messenger RNA expression were studied. In addition, TGF-Î² production and activation of Smad1/5/8 (ALK1) and Smad2/3 (ALK5) pathways were assessed.
Under HG conditions, deposition of Col6 and FN were increased 1.4- and 1.6-fold. This was significantly inhibited on the protein and messenger RNA level by L-carnosine. TGF-Î² production increased under HG conditions but was completely normalized by addition of L-carnosine. Addition of exogenous TGF-Î² could not overcome the effect of L-carnosine on Col6 and FN expression, indicating additionally interference with TGF-Î² downstream signalling.

2. OCA does not increase biliary cholesterol secretion but inhibits intestinal cholesterol absorption.
3. Activation of hepatic FXR leads to reduced bile acid pool size and altered bile acid composition, with an increased proportion of Î±/Î²-muricholic acid in bile and a decreased level of taurocholic acid (TCA).
4. Overexpression of Cyp8b1 or concurrent overexpression of Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1 normalizes TCA level, bile acid composition, and intestinal cholesterol absorption.

These findings suggest that FXR activation plays a significant role in regulating cholesterol metabolism and may be a potential therapeutic target for managing cholesterol-related disorders such as atherosclerosis.","Activation of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) markedly attenuates development of atherosclerosis in animal models. However, the underlying mechanism is not well elucidated. Here, we show that the FXR agonist, obeticholic acid (OCA), increases fecal cholesterol excretion and macrophage reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) dependent on activation of hepatic FXR. OCA does not increase biliary cholesterol secretion, but inhibits intestinal cholesterol absorption. OCA markedly inhibits hepatic cholesterol 7Î±-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1) and sterol 12Î±-hydroxylase (Cyp8b1) partly through inducing small heterodimer partner, leading to reduced bile acid pool size and altered bile acid composition, with the Î±/Î²-muricholic acid proportion in bile increased by 2.6-fold and taurocholic acid (TCA) level reduced by 71%. Overexpression of Cyp8b1 or concurrent overexpression of Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1 normalizes TCA level, bile acid composition, and intestinal cholesterol absorption."

You found significant correlations between D-dimer and C-reactive protein (CRP), and using Cox regression analysis, you assessed whether D-dimer could be an independent risk factor for mortality.

However, to answer the question more directly, it seems that your study results suggest that serum D-dimer level before CRRT may serve as a predictor of 28-day mortality in critically ill patients receiving CRRT treatment. This is because you found a significant association between higher D-dimer levels and increased risk of mortality within 28 days.

Since aldosterone is a neurohormone with established fibrotic properties, we aimed to investigate if mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) would modulate the prognostic value of Gal-3.
The IBLOMAVED cohort comprised 427 eligible chronic HF patients (CHF) with echocardiography and heart failure biomarkers assessments (BNP). After propensity score matching CHF patients for cardiovascular risk factors, to form balanced groups, Gal-3 levels were measured at baseline in plasma from patients treated with MRAs (MRA-Plus, n=101) or not (MRA-Neg, n=101). The primary end point was all-cause mortality with a follow-up of 3 years.
Gal-3 in plasma from these patients were similar with median values of 14.0 ng/mL [IQR, 9.9-19.3] and 14.4 ng/mL [IQR, 12.3-19.8] (P = 0.132) in MRA-Neg and MRA-Plus, respectively. Patients with Gal-3 â‰¤17.8 ng/mL had an HR of 1 (reference group) and 1.5 [0.4-5.7] in MRA-Neg and MRA-Plus, respectively (p=0.509). Patients with Gal-3 â‰¥ 17.8 ng/mL had an HR of 7.4 [2.2-24.6] and 9.0 [2.9-27.8] in MRA-Plus and MRA-Neg, respectively (p=0.539) and a median survival time of 2.4 years [95%CI,1.8-2.4]. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis confirmed that MRA and the interaction term between MRA treatment and Gal-3 >17.8 ng/mL were not factors associated with survival."

1504,19054501,"Studies have shown that schizophrenia patients have motion perception deficit, which was thought to cause eye-tracking abnormality in schizophrenia. However, eye movement closely interacts with motion perception. The known eye-tracking difficulties in schizophrenia patients may interact with their motion perception.

This suggests that the known eye-tracking difficulties in schizophrenia patients may indeed interact with their motion perception, potentially contributing to the motion perception deficit observed in schizophrenia. However, it's important to note that this is just one study and more research would be needed to confirm these findings and understand the underlying mechanisms.","Studies have shown that schizophrenia patients have motion perception deficit, which was thought to cause eye-tracking abnormality in schizophrenia. However, eye movement closely interacts with motion perception. The known eye-tracking difficulties in schizophrenia patients may interact with their motion perception.
Two speed discrimination experiments were conducted in a within-subject design. In experiment 1, the stimulus duration was 150 msec to minimize the chance of eye-tracking occurrence. In experiment 2, the duration was increased to 300 msec, increasing the possibility of eye movement intrusion. Regular eye-tracking performance was evaluated in a third experiment.
At 150 msec, speed discrimination thresholds did not differ between schizophrenia patients (n = 38) and control subjects (n = 33).

Considering this, we identified the presence of the subunits of AMPK in different hypothalamic nuclei involved in the pre- and post-pineal pathways that control seasonality of reproduction in the ewe and we investigated if the intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of two activators of AMPK, metformin and AICAR, affected the circadian rhythm of melatonin in ewes that were housed in constant darkness. In parallel the secretion of insulin was monitored as a peripheral metabolic marker. We also investigated the effects of i.c.v.

In bivariate analysis, parents of children with a regular clinician for preventive care reported slightly higher interpersonal quality (69 vs. 65 on a 0-100 scale, P = 0.01). Content of anticipatory guidance received was slightly greater for children with a regular clinician (82 vs. 80 on a 0-100 scale, P = 0.03). In bivariate analysis, a regular clinician was associated with interpersonal quality only among African American and Hispanic children. In multivariate analyses, controlling for factors that could independently influence self-reports of experiences with care, interpersonal quality but not anticipatory guidance content was higher for children with a regular clinician."

A retrospective study was conducted on 23 talar neck fractures recorded over a a period of thirteen years. The following variables were analysed: displacement of the fracture, soft tissue injury, delay and type of treatment, complications, observation of the Hawkins sign, and functional outcome.
There were 7 type I Hawkins fractures, 11 type II, and 4 type III and 1 type IV. Four cases developed avascular necrosis (2 Hawkins type II and 2 type III). Hawkins sign was observed in 12 cases, of which none developed necrosis. Four cases with negative Hawkins sign developed necrosis. No statistically significant differences were found when comparing the development of avascular necrosis with the displacement of the fracture, soft tissue injury, or delay in treatment. Differences were found when comparing the development of avascular necrosis with the Hawkins sign (P=.03)."

The role of mitochondria during PCD has been recognized in animals; however, it has been less studied during PCD in plants.
The following paper elucidates the role of mitochondrial dynamics during developmentally regulated PCD in vivo in A. madagascariensis. A single areole within a window stage leaf (PCD is occurring) was divided into three areas based on the progression of PCD; cells that will not undergo PCD (NPCD), cells in early stages of PCD (EPCD), and cells in late stages of PCD (LPCD).

This is a cost-utility study from a health care system's perspective comparing coformulated fixed dose (FXD) strategy versus multiple free dose combination (FRC) in antiretroviral therapy.
The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) was used to identify HIV/AIDS patients with â‰¥2 active antiretroviral medications. Patients on FXD were matched in 1:1 ratio with the FRC group using propensity scores. All medical costs excluding those paid by patients and families were included. Utility was measured using SF-6D scores from the SF-12 questionnaire. Incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) were calculated using the mean annual estimates. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve was determined using a Monte Carlo probabilistic simulation technique.
Nine FXD antiretroviral formulations approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by 2005 was included in this study. One hundred seventy HIV/AIDS patients with â‰¥2 antiretroviral agents were identified from the MEPS database, of which 53% (n=92) were on FXD formulation. On matching, 70 patients from FXD had a match from the FRC group. No differences in sociodemographic and health status variables were observed between the matched groups. The mean annual cost was $15,766.15 for FXD patients and $11,875.21 for FRC patients.

This is a cost-utility study from a health care system's perspective comparing coformulated fixed dose (FXD) strategy versus multiple free dose combination (FRC) in antiretroviral therapy.
The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) was used to identify HIV/AIDS patients with â‰¥2 active antiretroviral medications. Patients on FXD were matched in 1:1 ratio with the FRC group using propensity scores. All medical costs excluding those paid by patients and families were included. Utility was measured using SF-6D scores from the SF-12 questionnaire. Incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) were calculated using the mean annual estimates. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve was determined using a Monte Carlo probabilistic simulation technique.
Nine FXD antiretroviral formulations approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by 2005 was included in this study. One hundred seventy HIV/AIDS patients with â‰¥2 antiretroviral agents were identified from the MEPS database, of which 53% (n=92) were on FXD formulation. On matching, 70 patients from FXD had a match from the FRC group. No differences in sociodemographic and health status variables were observed between the matched groups. The mean annual cost was $15,766.15 for FXD patients and $11,875.21 for FRC patients.

As a new assessment method, we have suggested to assess the JL by means of radiographs of the contralateral knee. The most precise parameter was found to be the distance between the medial epicondyle and the JL. The level of arthritis, age, gender, visibility of the landmarks, and misalignment did not influence measurement accuracy. This parameter is the first femur-related landmark for assessing the JL, which advantageously corresponds to the femur-first technique in revision surgery.",FAIL,pubmedQA," The study you've described is exploring a novel approach for planning knee revision surgery by assessing joint line positions using the contralateral knee as a reference. This method involves measuring the distances from specific bony landmarks (fibular head, medial and lateral epicondyle, adductor tubercle) to the joint line on radiographic images of both knees.

In this study, the results show that the mean difference between the treated and control knee for the fibular head was 0.0 mm, with narrow confidence limits ranging from -1.1 to 1.1. This suggests that there is no significant difference in the position of the fibular head joint line between the treated and contralateral knees.

However, it's important to note that this study only focused on one bony landmark (the fibular head). Further research would be needed to confirm whether this approach can be applied consistently to other bony landmarks and whether it leads to improved outcomes in knee revision surgery. Additionally, the generalizability of these findings may depend on factors such as patient demographics, surgical history, and the specific techniques used for the revision surgery.

Overall, while this study provides some initial evidence supporting the use of the contralateral knee as a reference for joint line assessment in knee revision surgery, more research is needed to validate its clinical utility.","Reconstructing the natural joint line in knee revision surgery improves clinical and functional outcome but may be challenging when both cartilage and bone were removed during previous operations.

The combination of SLT and LRT has abolished deaths on the waiting list, thus raising the question whether living donor liver transplantation is still necessary.
Outcomes and postoperative liver function of 43 primary LRT patients were compared with those of 49 primary SLT patients (14 ex situ, 35 in situ) with known graft weight performed between April 1996 and December 2000. Survival rates were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method.
After a median follow-up of 35 months, actual patient survival rates were 82% in the SLT group and 88% in the LRT group. Actual graft survival rates were 76% and 81%, respectively. The incidence of primary nonfunction was 12% in the SLT group and 2.3% in the LRT group.

The study found that while there was a greater functional impairment seen in the PH-I group initially, the rate of decline in renal function over time was slower compared to the control group. At 2 years post-transplantation, there was no significant difference in eGFR between the two groups.

This suggests that pre-emptive liver transplantation for PH-I may still be a valuable option for children with early diagnosis, as it appears to help preserve renal function over time compared to liver transplantation for other indications.

Human T-lymphotrophic virus type I (HTLV-I) is known to cause two main diseases: HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). HAM/TSP is a chronic progressive disorder that primarily affects the spinal cord and causes motor dysfunction, sensory abnormalities, and other neurologic symptoms.

The patients in this study had positive anti-HTLV-I antibodies in both serum and CSF, which is consistent with HAM/TSP. Additionally, two of the three patients examined showed high risk of developing HAM/TSP in virologic and immunologic aspects. However, it's important to note that only one patient had biopsied sample from spinal cord lesions showing inflammatory changes, which is a characteristic feature of HAM/TSP.

It seems that the study is investigating whether these patients have a variant form of HAM/TSP or a different manifestation of HTLV-I infection, as two patients had demyelinating type of sensorimotor polyneuropathy instead of the typical myelopathy associated with HAM/TSP.

1574,23356465,"Various factors contribute to the effective implementation of evidence-based treatments (EBTs). In this study, cognitive processing therapy (CPT) was administered in a Veterans Affairs (VA) posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) specialty clinic in which training and supervision were provided following VA implementation guidelines. The aim was to (a) estimate the proportion of variability in outcome attributable to therapists and (b) identify characteristics of those therapists who produced better outcomes.
We used an archival database of veterans (n = 192) who completed 12 sessions of CPT by therapists (n = 25) who were trained by 2 nationally recognized trainers, 1 of whom also provided weekly group supervision. Multilevel modeling was used to estimate therapist effects, with therapists treated as a random factor. The supervisor was asked to retrospectively rate each therapist in terms of perceived effectiveness based on supervision interactions. Using single case study design, the supervisor was interviewed to determine what criteria she used to rate the therapists and emerging themes were coded.
When initial level of severity on the PTSD Checklist (PCL; McDonald&Calhoun, 2010; Weathers, Litz, Herman, Huska,&Keane, 1993) was taken into account, approximately 12% of the variability in the PCL at the end of treatment was due to therapists.

The EBP unit showed a decrease in mortality rate and length of stay for patients, while no statistically significant improvements were seen in the SP physicians' performance. However, it is important to note that before the reorganization, there were no statistically significant differences between the EBP and SP doctors. Despite attending twice as many patients per doctor, EBP patients had a lower risk of death and shorter length of stay than SP patients. Readmission rates were similar in both units. This study suggests that implementing an EBP unit may lead to better patient outcomes, but more research is needed to confirm these findings and understand the reasons behind the differences observed.","Evidence-based practice (EBP) is widely promoted, but does EBP produce better patient outcomes? We report a natural experiment when part of the internal medicine service in a hospital was reorganized in 2003 to form an EBP unit, the rest of the service remaining unchanged.

We used routinely collected statistics (2004-11) to compare the two different methods of practice and test whether patients being seen by the EBP unit differed from standard practice (SP) patients. Data were available by doctor and year. To check for differences between the EBP and SP doctors prior to reorganization, we used statistics from 2000 to 2003. We looked for changes in patient outcomes or activity following reorganization and whether the EBP unit was achieving significantly different results from SP. Data across the periods were combined and tested using Mann-Whitney test.

The use of the modified lithotomy position during pelvic surgery is associated with lower limb ischemia.

While this study suggests that Trendelenburg position may not increase the risk of a venous air embolism during liver resection as previously believed, it does not necessarily mean that Lloyd-Davies position is without risk. It's always crucial to consider individual patient factors and potential complications when making decisions about patient positioning during surgery.

1581,19394934,"The incidence of large-scale urban attacks on civilian populations has significantly increased across the globe over the past decade. These incidents often result in Hospital Multiple Casualty Incidents (HMCI), which are very challenging to hospital teams. 15 years ago the Emergency and Disaster Medicine Division in the Israeli Ministry of Health defined a key of 20 percent of each hospital's bed capacity as its readiness for multiple casualties. Half of those casualties are expected to require immediate medical treatment. This study was performed to evaluate the efficacy of the current readiness guidelines based on the epidemiology of encountered HMCIs.
A retrospective study of HMCIs was recorded in the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) home front command and the Israeli National Trauma Registry (ITR) between November 2000 and June 2003.

Hospital preparedness can be better defined by a fixed number of casualties rather than a percentile of its bed capacity. Nearly 50% of the arriving casualties will require immediate medical treatment. Implementation of this concept may improve the utilisation of national emergency health resources both in the preparation phase and on real time.,FAIL,pubmedQA," The study suggests that the current readiness guidelines for Israeli hospitals in terms of surge capacity for multiple casualty incidents may need to be reevaluated, as only half of the casualties (79.2%) arriving at a hospital during an HMCI required immediate medical treatment. This is significantly lower than the expected 50% based on the current readiness guidelines.

The study also indicates that in 95% of the HMCIs, the number of casualties did not exceed 52. This suggests that hospitals may need to prepare for a smaller number of casualties than previously assumed. However, it's important to note that this is still a significant number and requires careful planning and preparation.

In terms of predicting the severity distribution of injuries, the study found that most casualties (79.2%) did not require immediate medical treatment, with a majority having an Injury Severity Score (ISS) below 16. This suggests that hospitals can potentially better prepare for the types of injuries they are likely to encounter during an HMCI.

In conclusion, while the current readiness guidelines may need to be revised, hospitals can still improve their preparedness by focusing on the types of injuries that are most commonly encountered in HMCIs and ensuring they have the resources to handle a smaller number of casualties than previously assumed.","The incidence of large-scale urban attacks on civilian populations has significantly increased across the globe over the past decade.

(ii) To test the hypothesis that this relationship could be explained by: (a) reporting of psychological factors, (b) common association of self-reported mechanical factors with other unexplained syndromes.
A population based cross-sectional study of 4200 randomly selected adults registered with a General Medical Practice in North West, England. The study examined the association of chronic oro-facial pain with a variety of self-reported mechanical factors: teeth grinding, facial trauma, missing teeth and the feeling that the teeth did not fit together properly. Information was also collected on demographic factors, psychological factors and the reporting of other frequently unexplained syndromes.
An adjusted response rate of 72% was achieved. Only two mechanical factors: teeth grinding (odds ratio (OR) 2.0, 95% CI 1.3-3.0) and facial trauma (OR 2.0; 95% CI 1.3-2.9) were independently associated with chronic oro-facial pain after adjusting for psychological factors. However, these factors were also commonly associated with the reporting of other frequently unexplained syndromes: teeth grinding (odds ratio (OR) 1.8, 95% CI 1.5-2.2), facial trauma (OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.7-2.6)."

1614,19606226,"Early life nutrition is critical for the development of hypothalamic neurons involved in energy homeostasis. We previously showed that intrauterine and early postnatal overnutrition programmed hypothalamic neurons expressing the appetite stimulator neuropeptide Y (NPY) and suppressor proopiomelanocortin (POMC) in offspring at weaning. However, the long-term effects of such programming and its interactions with post-weaning high-fat-diet (HFD) consumption are unclear.
Female Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to chow or HFD for 5 weeks before mating, throughout gestation and lactation. On postnatal day 1, litters were adjusted to 3/litter to induce postnatal overnutrition (vs. 12 in control). At postnatal day 20, half of the rats from each maternal group were weaned onto chow or HFD for 15 weeks. Hypothalamic appetite regulators, and fuel (glucose and lipid) metabolic markers were measured.
Offspring from obese dams gained more weight than those from lean dams independent of post-weaning diet. Maternal obesity interacted with post-weaning HFD consumption to cause greater levels of hyperphagia, adiposity, hyperlipidemia, and glucose intolerance in offspring. This was linked to increased hypothalamic NPY signaling and leptin resistance in adult offspring.

There were strong additive effects of maternal obesity and post-weaning HFD consumption to increase the metabolic disorders in offspring.",FAIL,pubmedQA," Yes, it appears that maternal obesity can program the hypothalamic neuroendocrine circuitry, particularly involving neuropeptide Y (NPY) and proopiomelanocortin (POMC), in offspring. This programming seems to interact with the postnatal nutritional environment, especially a high-fat diet (HFD), leading to long-term effects such as hyperphagia, adiposity, hyperlipidemia, and glucose intolerance in the offspring. These effects are linked to increased hypothalamic NPY signaling and leptin resistance. Interestingly, litter size reduction also seems to have a detrimental impact on insulin and adiponectin levels, while hypothalamic NPY and POMC mRNA expression is suppressed despite normal energy intake and weight gain.","Early life nutrition is critical for the development of hypothalamic neurons involved in energy homeostasis. We previously showed that intrauterine and early postnatal overnutrition programmed hypothalamic neurons expressing the appetite stimulator neuropeptide Y (NPY) and suppressor proopiomelanocortin (POMC) in offspring at weaning. However, the long-term effects of such programming and its interactions with post-weaning high-fat-diet (HFD) consumption are unclear.
Female Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to chow or HFD for 5 weeks before mating, throughout gestation and lactation. On postnatal day 1, litters were adjusted to 3/litter to induce postnatal overnutrition (vs. 12 in control). At postnatal day 20, half of the rats from each maternal group were weaned onto chow or HFD for 15 weeks. Hypothalamic appetite regulators, and fuel (glucose and lipid) metabolic markers were measured.
Offspring from obese dams gained more weight than those from lean dams independent of post-weaning diet. Maternal obesity interacted with post-weaning HFD consumption to cause greater levels of hyperphagia, adiposity, hyperlipidemia, and glucose intolerance in offspring. This was linked to increased hypothalamic NPY signaling and leptin resistance in adult offspring. Litter size reduction had a detrimental impact on insulin and adiponectin, while hypothalamic NPY and POMC mRNA expression were suppressed in the face of normal energy intake and weight gain."

To quantitate the number of symptomatic instrumentation failures (SIFs) encountered during a 2-year period. The effect of sagittal plane imbalance (corrected or uncorrected) on the rate of SIF was evaluated.
Retrospective evaluation of all patients requiring spinal instrumentation to determine which factors predispose toward instrumentation failure.
All patients requiring spinal instrumentation over a 2-year period were retrospectively studied.
Sagittal plane imbalance pre- and postoperatively was determined using Cobb angle analysis on plain X-rays. SIF was defined as screw back-out and/or breakage, pseudarthrosis, cage migration, or rod disconnection in patients with concordant symptoms. Asymptomatic patients did not demonstrate instrumentation failure on the routine postoperative X-rays.
Of the 355 patients who fit the criteria, 47 patients presented with either idiopathic or secondary sagittal plane deformity preoperatively. Additionally, long-segment fixation, smoking, age, and fixation across junctional segments were evaluated as risk factors for SIF.
Of the 47 patients with sagittal plane deformity, 40 patients (85%) achieved correction demonstrated on postoperative radiographs whereas in 7 (15%), the sagittal plane imbalance was not corrected. Of these seven cases, five suffered instrumentation failure (failure rate 71.5%) versus no instrumentation failures (failure rate 0%) for the remaining 40 patients. SIF was demonstrated in 10 patients overall (failure rate of 2.8%). There was no correlation found between factors such as age, indications for surgery, or long-segment fixation, and instrumentation failure."

In many cell types, transforming factor (TGF)-beta inhibits proliferation by inducing G1-phase arrest. Evidence indicates that corneal endothelial cells synthesize mRNA for TGF-beta1 and are also bathed in aqueous humor that contains TGF-beta2 (mainly in a latent form). As such, this cytokine may maintain the corneal endothelium in a G1-phase-arrested state in vivo. The purpose of these studies was to determine the effect of exogenous TGF-beta2 and TGF-beta2 in aqueous humor on DNA synthesis in cultured corneal endothelial cells.
Rat corneal endothelial cells were grown in explant culture and identified by morphology and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using primers for specific corneal cell markers. Subconfluent cells were synchronized in the G0 phase (quiescence) by serum starvation for 24 hours. Serum was then added to the cells in the presence or absence of exogenous TGF-beta2 or activated rat aqueous humor. [3H]Thymidine was added, and radioactivity was measured at various time points to detect DNA synthesis. Preincubation of exogenous TGF-beta2 or activated rat aqueous humor with neutralizing antibody was used to test for cytokine specificity.
A linear increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation began approximately 16 hours after serum addition, and peak incorporation occurred at approximately 24 hours. Exposure of cells to serum plus TGF-beta2 suppressed [3H]thymidine incorporation in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations ranging from 5 pg/ml to 5 ng/ml. [3H]Thymidine incorporation was also suppressed in cells exposed to serum plus rat aqueous humor diluted 1:10. Neutralizing antibody reversed the effects of both exogenous TGF-beta2 and aqueous humor."

Using a well-established model of epithelial restitution, IEC-6 cells were plated on 60-mm Matrigel-coated plastic dishes and grown to confluence. The epithelium was wounded by scraping with a 6-mm-wide blade to create a smooth denuded edge and cell migration was measured 8 h later. Cells were grown in control DMEM with 5% FBS with or without 0.01-2 mM taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA). In parallel experiments, cells were harvested for Northern analysis of TGFbeta and GAPDH expression; [3H]thymidine uptake was used to measure proliferation. Anti-TGFbeta antibody was added to cells grown in the presence of 0.05 mM TDCA and migration was measured at 8 h.

This is based on the findings from the study where TDCA at physiologic luminal concentrations augmented IEC-6 cell migration, and this effect was eliminated when TGFbeta function was blocked with an antibody. Additionally, TGFbeta expression increased in response to bile acid, suggesting a role for TGFbeta in this repair process.","In addition to aiding in the digestion of fats, luminal bile salts have been shown to modulate gastrointestinal epithelial growth, differentiation, and other functions. We hypothesized that bile acids could modulate the intestinal mucosal repair process of restitution. We investigated the effect of the bile salt taurodeoxycholic acid on epithelial migration and identified a role for TGFbeta, a widely expressed cytokine in the intestinal villus, in this repair process.
Using a well-established model of epithelial restitution, IEC-6 cells were plated on 60-mm Matrigel-coated plastic dishes and grown to confluence. The epithelium was wounded by scraping with a 6-mm-wide blade to create a smooth denuded edge and cell migration was measured 8 h later. Cells were grown in control DMEM with 5% FBS with or without 0.01-2 mM taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA). In parallel experiments, cells were harvested for Northern analysis of TGFbeta and GAPDH expression; [3H]thymidine uptake was used to measure proliferation. Anti-TGFbeta antibody was added to cells grown in the presence of 0.05 mM TDCA and migration was measured at 8 h.

To evaluate the effect of low- versus high-leukocyte concentrated PRP products on catabolic and anabolic mediators of matrix metabolism in diseased rotator cuff tendons.
Controlled laboratory study.
Diseased supraspinatus tendons were treated with PRP made by use of 2 commercial systems: Arthrex Autologous Conditioned Plasma Double Syringe System (L(lo) PRP) and Biomet GPS III Mini Platelet Concentrate System (L(hi) PRP). Tendon explants were placed in 6-well plates and cultured in L(lo) PRP, L(hi) PRP, or control media (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium + 10% fetal bovine serum) for 96 hours. Tendons were processed for hematoxylin-eosin histologic results and were scored with the modified Bonar scale. Group 1 tendons were defined as moderate tendinopathy (Bonar score <3); group 2 tendons were assessed as severely affected (Bonar score = 3). Transforming growth factor Î²-1 (TGFÎ²-1), interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²), interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) concentrations in PRP media were measured by use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay after 96 hours of culture with diseased tendon. Tendon messenger RNA expression of collagen type I (COL1A1), collagen type III (COL3A1), cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), MMP-9, MMP-13, and IL-1Î² was measured with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
Leukocytes and platelets were significantly more concentrated in L(hi) PRP compared with L(lo) PRP. Increased IL-1Î² was present in L(hi) PRP after culture with group 1 tendons. IL-6 was increased in L(hi) PRP after culture with group 2 tendons. Both TGFÎ²-1 and MMP-9 were increased in L(hi) PRP after culture with either tendon group. In L(lo) PRP cultures, IL-1Ra:IL-1Î² in PRP used as media and COL1A1:COL3A1 gene expression were increased for group 1 tendon cultures.

L(hi) PRP promotes normal collagen matrix synthesis and decreases cytokines associated with matrix degradation and inflammation to a greater extent than does L(lo) PRP in moderately degenerative tendons. In severely degenerative tendons, neither PRP preparation enhanced matrix synthesis.",FAIL,pubmedQA," The study suggests that high leukocyte concentrated Platelet-Rich Plasma (L(hi) PRP) may have a more pronounced effect on the catabolic and anabolic mediators of matrix metabolism in diseased rotator cuff tendons compared to low leukocyte concentrated PRP (L(lo) PRP). Specifically, L(hi) PRP showed increased levels of IL-1Î², IL-6, TGFÎ²-1, and MMP-9 after culture with both moderate and severely affected tendon groups. However, in the case of L(lo) PRP, it appeared to have a more beneficial effect on moderately affected tendons, as it increased IL-1Ra:IL-1Î² in PRP media and COL1A1:COL3A1 gene expression. For severely affected tendons, L(lo) PRP showed an increase in the gene expression of MMP-9 and IL-1Î² but did not significantly affect MMP-13 or COMP expression. This suggests that while both types of PRP may have some effect on matrix metabolism, high leukocyte PRP might be more potent in modifying the catabolic and anabolic factors, potentially leading to a less normalized matrix metabolism in torn human rotator cuff tendons. However, further clinical studies are needed to confirm these findings and determine the optimal PRP for treatment of supraspinatus tendinopathy.","The optimal platelet-rich plasma (PRP) for treatment of supraspinatus tendinopathy has not been determined.

We investigated the effect of androgens and leptin on gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) expression and secretion in human GnRH-secreting neuroblasts (FNC-B4).
Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR for mRNA expression and radioimmunoassay for GnRH secretion were used. Immunohistochemical studies assessed GnRH protein expression. FNC-B4 migration was analyzed with multiwell Boyden chamber technique.
Effects of the non-aromatizable androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and leptin in FNC-B4 were tested after 24 and 48 hours.
Exposure to increasing concentrations of DHT after 24 hours significantly stimulated GnRH mRNA in FNC-B4. This effect was still present after prolonged exposure (48 hours). Similarly, treatment with leptin significantly induced GnRH mRNA after 24 hours, but not at 48 hours. Interestingly, mRNA for leptin receptors (LEPR) was significantly reduced after 48 hours of leptin, while, at this time point, it was stimulated by DHT. Coincubation for 48 hours with leptin and DHT maintained the stimulatory effect on both GnRH and LEPR mRNA, suggesting that DHT could stabilize the leptin effect by preventing downregulation of LEPR. Similar results were obtained for GnRH protein expression analysis. Moreover, both DHT and leptin increased GnRH release into the culture medium. We also found that DHT or leptin treatment significantly increased FNC-B4 basal migration.

Despite multiple reports in the literature of malignant spread along the needle track, the potential effect of lung cancer dissemination after PTNB on survival is unknown.
To evaluate whether diagnostic PTNB is associated with increased risk of lung cancer death.
This study included 8,607 cases of surgically resected stage I non-small cell lung cancer diagnosed between 1991 and 1999 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry linked to Medicare records. Overall and lung cancer-specific survival of patients who had and did not have PTNB was compared using Kaplan-Meier curves. Stratified survival analyses and Cox regression were used to compare survival with adjustment for potential confounders.
Approximately 36% of patients underwent diagnostic PTNB. Overall and lung cancer-specific survival did not differ in patients that underwent PTNB as part of their cancer diagnostic work-up and those who did not (p = 0.57 and 0.46, respectively). In stratified and multivariate analysis, PTNB was not associated with an increased risk of death after controlling for age, race, income, access to care, comorbidities, tumor histology and size, and type of treatment received."

Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to determine the significance of race as an independent predictor of surgical margin status after radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer.
After controlling for clinical stage, Gleason grade, and preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA), multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that race was not an independent predictor of positive surgical margins (P = 0.9). Of the variables evaluated, both preoperative PSA (P = 0.0005) and biopsy Gleason grade (P = 0.047) were significant predictors of an increased risk of a positive surgical margin."

1700,24500507,"To evaluate weight retention 12 months postpartum and factors associated among women who had received prenatal care at Health Care Centers in Porto Alegre, southern Brazil.
Pregnant women in the last trimester were identified at 20 Health Care Centers. Socioeconomic, demographic and anthropometrics data were obtained. Six and 12 months after delivery, the women received home visits for anthropometric measures. The gestational weight gain was defined by pre-pregnancy Body Mass Index (BMI). Weight retention was defined as the difference between pre-gestational weight and weight at postpartum. Data were analyzed using McNemar's Test, ANOVA with Bonferroni correction and multiple linear regression.
Of the 715 pregnant women recruited, 545 were assessed 12 months after delivery. Women were more likely to be overweight 12 months postpartum compared to the pre-pregnancy period (52.9 versus 36.7%) and weight retention during the 12 months postpartum was more than 10 kg in 30.7% of the women. Weight retention in the postpartum period was higher among women who were overweight (9.9 Â± 7.7 kg) compared to those who were of normal weight during the pre-pregnancy period (7.6 Â± 6.2 kg). Pre-pregnancy BMI, gestational weight gain, and maternal age were associated with gestational weight retention 12 months postpartum (p<0.001).",Is [ Excessive gestational weight gain risk factor for overweight among women ]?,No. Adequate prenatal care is necessary to minimize the adverse effects of excessive weight gain during pregnancy on women's health.,FAIL,pubmedQA," Yes, excessive gestational weight gain is a risk factor for overweight among women, as it increases the likelihood of pregnancy-induced hypertensive disorders. This risk is particularly high for women who are already overweight or obese before pregnancy and those with higher average third-trimester glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. The study also found that prepregnancy body weight, specifically being overweight or obese, had the strongest impact on pregnancy-related hypertensive disorders.","The aim of this study was to measure the capacity of glucose- and weight-related parameters to predict pregnancy-induced hypertensive disorders in women with gestational diabetes.
An observational study was conducted involving 2037 women with gestational diabetes. The associations of glycaemic and weight-related parameters with pregnancy-induced hypertensive disorders were obtained by univariate and adjusted multivariate analyses. Also, model predictability and attributable predictor risk percentages were calculated, and collinearity and factor interactions examined.
Multivariate analyses revealed that hypertensive disorders were mainly predicted by average third-trimester glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) levels â‰¥ 5.9%, by being overweight or obese before pregnancy and by excess gestational weight gain after adjusting for age, tobacco use, chronic hypertension, parity, urinary tract infections and gestational age at delivery. Prepregnancy body weight (overweight and obesity) had the strongest impact on pregnancy-related hypertensive disorders (attributable risk percentages were 51.5% and 88.8%, respectively). The effect of being overweight or obese on hypertensive disorders was enhanced by HbA(1c) levels and gestational weight gain, with elevated HbA(1c) levels multiplying the effect of being overweight before pregnancy."

In the presence of epicardial stenosis, MR was calculated by taking collateral flow, as measured by the coronary wedge pressure, into consideration. After removal of epicardial stenosis, MR was calculated simply as distal coronary pressure divided by average peak velocity. When collateral flow was incorporated into the calculation, MR increased significantly from 1.70 Â± 0.76 to 2.05 Â± 0.72 (p=0.001) after PCI in the whole population. Periprocedural changes (Î”) in absolute values of MR and troponin T correlated significantly (r=0.629, p=0.0001). In patients who developed periprocedural myocardial infarction, MR increased significantly after PCI (1.48 Â± 0.73 versus 2.28 Â± 0.71, p<0.001). Nevertheless, removal of the epicardial lesion did not change MR in patients without periprocedural MI (1.91Â±0.73 versus 1.81Â±0.67, p=0.1)."

1778,12198220,"Hypertension (HT) is common in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and is responsible for increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In this study, we aimed to determine the prevalence of 'uncontrolled HT' during background therapy in CAPD patients by using office measurements and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). We further determined whether intravascular volume status, assessed by inferior vena cava diameter (IVCD) index, contributes to higher blood pressure (BP) and increased left ventricular mass index (LVMI).
Seventy-four CAPD patients were included in the final analysis. All patients underwent echocardiographic examination and received ABPM. Patients undergoing CAPD were categorized into two groups: 'uncontrolled HT' (Group A) and 'normotensive and controlled HT' (Group B). Intravascular volume status was determined using the IVCD index and collapsibility index (CI) on the same day as ABPM.
The prevalence of HT was 84% when using office measurements and 82% when using daytime ABPM. Daytime BP was 147/92 mm Hg by office measurements and 145/91 mm Hg by ABPM (P>0.05). The prevalence of 'uncontrolled HT' measured by ABPM was 73% (n=54).

A catheter was inserted in the distal part of the splenic vein of the pancreas graft. After reperfusion blood samples were taken from this catheter and blood flow was measured by the venous outflow method. The degree of graft pancreatitis was assessed by peak-C-reactive protein (CRP) defined as highest CRP within 3 days after transplantation.

The study found a significant negative correlation between peak-C-reactive protein (CRP) and tissue pO2 60 minutes after reperfusion, indicating that lower tissue pO2 levels (indicating impaired microcirculation) were associated with higher CRP levels (a marker of inflammation and graft pancreatitis). Additionally, donor age was found to correlate significantly with peak-CRP, suggesting that older donors may be at greater risk for graft pancreatitis.","Graft pancreatitis is thought to be induced by ischemia/reperfusion. Animal experiments have suggested that an impaired microcirculation is crucial in this process. We have therefore studied the relevance of microcirculation in clinical pancreas transplantation.
In 17 patients undergoing pancreas transplantation, tissue pO2 was monitored continuously by an electrode implanted into the pancreatic tail. A catheter was inserted in the distal part of the splenic vein of the pancreas graft. After reperfusion blood samples were taken from this catheter and blood flow was measured by the venous outflow method. The degree of graft pancreatitis was assessed by peak-C-reactive protein (CRP) defined as highest CRP within 3 days after transplantation.

These data highlight the mandatory role of F-actin in platelet biogenesis.,Do cdc42-dependent F-actin dynamics drive structuration of the demarcation membrane system in megakaryocytes?,"No. Background Blood platelet biogenesis results from the maturation of megakaryocytes (MKs), which involves the development of a complex demarcation membrane system (DMS). Therefore, MK differentiation is an attractive model for studying membrane remodeling. Objectives We sought to investigate the mechanism of DMS structuration in relationship to the cytoskeleton. Results Using three-dimensional (3D) confocal imaging, we have identified consecutive stages of DMS organization that rely on microtubule dynamics to polarize membranes and nuclei territories. Interestingly, F-actin is not involved in this process. We found that the mechanism underlying microtubule-dependent DMS formation required the activation of the guanosine triphosphate hydrolase Cdc42 and its p21-activated kinase effectors (Pak1/2/3). FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer demonstrated that active Cdc42 was associated with endomembrane dynamics throughout terminal maturation. Inhibition of Cdc42 or Pak1/2/3 severely destructured the DMS and blocked proplatelet formation. Even though this process does not require containment within the hematopoietic niche, because DMS structuration was observed upon thrombopoietin-treatment in suspension, integrin outside-in signaling was required for Pak activation and probably resulted from secretion of extracellular matrix by MKs. Conclusions These data indicate a functional link, mandatory for MK differentiation, between microtubule dynamics, regulated by Cdc42/Pak1/2/3, and DMS maturation.",FAIL,pubmedQA," Yes, according to the provided context, it appears that cdc42-dependent F-actin dynamics play a crucial role in structuring the demarcation membrane system (DMS) during megakaryopoiesis (the process of producing megakaryocytes).

These beneficial effects are associated with inhibitory actions on VSMC and macrophage functions.,FAIL,pubmedQA," Yes, local delivery of pravastatin appears to inhibit intimal hyperplasia in a mouse vein graft model. This is demonstrated by the significant reduction in intimal hyperplasia observed 4 weeks after surgery when compared to the vehicle group. The mechanism seems to involve decreased proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and macrophages, as shown by reduced immunostaining for proliferating cell nuclear antigen and Mac-3 in VSMCs, and decreased platelet-derived growth factor-induced VSMC migration and monocyte chemotactic protein-1-induced macrophage migration.","Pravastatin can reduce atherosclerotic progression in patients after coronary artery bypass graft. However, it is unknown whether pravastatin has a direct effect on intimal hyperplasia of grafted vessels in vivo or what the underlying mechanisms may be. In this study, a murine vein graft model was applied to deal with these issues.
Vein grafting was performed between C57BL/6J mice. Immediately after operation, pravastatin (30 Î¼M) or phosphate-buffered saline in 50 Î¼L 20% pluronic F-127 gel was delivered to the adventitia of grafted vessels.
Compared with the vehicle, pravastatin significantly reduced intimal hyperplasia 4 weeks after the surgical procedure. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are a major component of the neointima. The percentage of cells positive for proliferating cell nuclear antigen and Mac-3-positive immunostaining intensity within the intima of vein grafts was significantly lower in the pravastatin-treated group than in the control group. We separated VSMCs from mouse inferior vena cava and collected peritoneal macrophage from mice injected intraperitoneally with 4% thioglycollate. Pravastatin significantly decreased VSMC proliferation and platelet-derived growth factor-induced VSMC migration and, in a dose-dependent manner, inhibited macrophage migration induced by monocyte chemotactic protein-1."

The emergence of drug-resistant and nosocomial TB in HIV infection poses serious challenges in Africa. Appropriate measures to address this issue include strengthening TB diagnostic capacity, improving infection control practices, and ensuring timely and effective treatment for both TB and HIV.

In conclusion, the co-infection of TB and HIV presents a significant health challenge in sub-Saharan Africa. Early diagnosis, appropriate drug regimens, and prevention strategies are crucial in managing this co-infection. The emergence of drug-resistant and nosocomial TB in HIV infection necessitates strengthened efforts to address these challenges.","Tuberculosis (TB) is an important cause of mortality and morbidity in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in Africa. The interaction between TB and HIV infections is reviewed.
Literature on TB, HIV and their co-infection, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, including Nigeria, is reviewed.
Burden of TB is fueled by the HIV epidemic, and clinical presentation of TB may be atypical with co-infection. Recommendations on drugs and timing of antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation are discussed. Use of cotrimoxazole prophylaxis (CPT) in co-infected patients reduces morbidity and mortality, while the principles of TB prevention in HIV infection can be summarized with the three I's: intensive TB case finding and surveillance, isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) and infection-control measures; to these can be added a fourth 'I,' viz., instituting ART. Clinical complications like drug resistance, toxicity and drug interactions; and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) with CPT, IPT and ART are highlighted. Emergence of drug-resistant- and nosocomial- TB in HIV infection poses serious challenges and potential consequences in Africa, and appropriate measures are recommended."

1836,19344532,"Plastids arose from a free-living cyanobacterial endosymbiont and multiply by binary division as do cyanobacteria. Plastid division involves nucleus-encoded homologs of cyanobacterial division proteins such as FtsZ, MinD, MinE, and ARC6. However, homologs of many other cyanobacterial division genes are missing in plant genomes and proteins of host eukaryotic origin, such as a dynamin-related protein, PDV1 and PDV2 are involved in the division process. Recent identification of plastid division proteins has started to elucidate the similarities and differences between plastid division and cyanobacterial cell division. To further identify new proteins that are required for plastid division, we characterized previously and newly isolated plastid division mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana.
Leaf cells of two mutants, br04 and arc2, contain fewer, larger chloroplasts than those of wild type. We found that ARC2 and BR04 are identical to nuclear genes encoding the plastid chaperonin 60 alpha (ptCpn60alpha) and chaperonin 60 beta (ptCpn60beta) proteins, respectively. In both mutants, plastid division FtsZ ring formation was partially perturbed though the level of FtsZ2-1 protein in plastids of ptcpn60beta mutants was similar to that in wild type. Phylogenetic analyses showed that both ptCpn60 proteins are derived from ancestral cyanobacterial proteins. The A. thaliana genome encodes two members of ptCpn60alpha family and four members of ptCpn60beta family respectively. We found that a null mutation in ptCpn60alpha abolished greening of plastids and resulted in an albino phenotype while a weaker mutation impairs plastid division and reduced chlorophyll levels.

Since moderate reduction of ptCpn60 levels did not impair normal FtsZ ring formation but did affect import of FtsZ into plastids, it is suggested that the proper levels of ptCpn60 are not required for folding of stromal plastid division proteins and/or regulation of FtsZ polymer dynamics.",FAIL,pubmedQA," Yes, plastid chaperonin proteins Cpn60 alpha (ptCpn60alpha) and Cpn60 beta (ptCpn60beta) are required for plastid division in Arabidopsis thaliana.

1846,23035925,"Directional preferences during center-out horizontal shoulder-elbow movements were previously established for both the dominant and non-dominant arm with the use of a free-stroke drawing task that required random selection of movement directions. While the preferred directions were mirror-symmetrical in both arms, they were attributed to a tendency specific for the dominant arm to simplify control of interaction torque by actively accelerating one joint and producing largely passive motion at the other joint. No conclusive evidence has been obtained in support of muscle effort minimization as a contributing factor to the directional preferences. Here, we tested whether distal load changes directional preferences, making the influence of muscle effort minimization on the selection of movement direction more apparent.
The free-stroke drawing task was performed by the dominant and non-dominant arm with no load and with 0.454 kg load at the wrist. Motion of each arm was limited to rotation of the shoulder and elbow in the horizontal plane. Directional histograms of strokes produced by the fingertip were calculated to assess directional preferences in each arm and load condition. Possible causes for directional preferences were further investigated by studying optimization across directions of a number of cost functions.
Preferences in both arms to move in the diagonal directions were revealed. The previously suggested tendency to actively accelerate one joint and produce passive motion at the other joint was supported in both arms and load conditions. However, the load increased the tendency to produce strokes in the transverse diagonal directions (perpendicular to the forearm orientation) in both arms.

We hypothesized that LBV patients would have a faster cognitive decline and shorter survival compared with patients with pure AD.
Prior reports have shown extrapyramidal signs to be associated with a poorer prognosis in AD. It has been suggested that LBV is often characterized by a rapidly progressive course. Few data are available regarding the rate of cognitive decline in autopsy-confirmed LBV dementia cases.
We searched the databases of the University of California-San Diego Alzheimer's Disease Research Center and the Consortium to Establish a Registry in Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) for dementia cases with 1) an autopsy diagnosis of definite or probable AD (CERAD criteria) with concomitant Lewy bodies and 2) longitudinal MMSE assessments. This resulted in a series of 40 LBV cases and 148 AD cases without Lewy bodies, with comparable baseline MMSE scores, age, and education. The rate of cognitive decline was calculated as the baseline MMSE -- final MMSE. Methods were devised to reduce floor effects on the MMSE.
The average rate of cognitive decline was -5.8 +/- 4.5 points/y in LBV and -4.1 +/- 3.0 points/y in AD (t-test, p < 0.01). The LBV group declined a similar amount on the MMSE (means, -10.0 versus -9.6 points) over a significantly shorter time interval (1.9 versus 2.7 years; p = 0.005) than did AD patients. At baseline, the mean MMSE scores were nearly identical (18.2 in LBV; 17.8 in AD), but on follow-up examinations approximately 1, 2, and 3 years later, there were intergroup mean differences of 1.8 points (two-tailed p = 0.19), 4.2 points (p = 0.04), and 5.6 points (p = 0.03), respectively. The LBV cases had shorter survival time from the onset of cognitive symptoms (7.7 +/- 3.0 years versus 9.3 +/- 3.5 years; p = 0.007) and a shorter mean survival after entry/baseline, which was of marginal significance (3.6 versus 4.1 years; p = 0.11).",Is cognitive decline faster in Lewy body variant than in Alzheimer 's disease?,No. This study demonstrates that LBV is characterized by a slower cognitive decline and decelerated mortality compared with AD.,FAIL,pubmedQA," Yes, according to the study, cognitive decline appears to be faster in Lewy body variant (LBV) than in Alzheimer's disease (AD), as evidenced by a more rapid rate of decline on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and a shorter time interval over which this decline occurred. However, it's important to note that this is based on the specific context and data presented in the question. For a comprehensive understanding, one should refer to the full study or consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.","To quantify the rate of cognitive decline on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in autopsy-diagnosed Lewy body variant (LBV) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases. We hypothesized that LBV patients would have a faster cognitive decline and shorter survival compared with patients with pure AD.
Prior reports have shown extrapyramidal signs to be associated with a poorer prognosis in AD. It has been suggested that LBV is often characterized by a rapidly progressive course. Few data are available regarding the rate of cognitive decline in autopsy-confirmed LBV dementia cases.
We searched the databases of the University of California-San Diego Alzheimer's Disease Research Center and the Consortium to Establish a Registry in Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) for dementia cases with 1) an autopsy diagnosis of definite or probable AD (CERAD criteria) with concomitant Lewy bodies and 2) longitudinal MMSE assessments. This resulted in a series of 40 LBV cases and 148 AD cases without Lewy bodies, with comparable baseline MMSE scores, age, and education. The rate of cognitive decline was calculated as the baseline MMSE -- final MMSE. Methods were devised to reduce floor effects on the MMSE.

We therefore predicted that characteristics of the great call would correlate with a caller's physical condition, and thus might honestly reflect resource holding potential (RHP).

We investigated whether the influence of MDD on colitis resulted from an ER stress response triggered by decreased SIRT1 expression.
The unfolded protein response (UPR), chaperones proteins, heat shock factor protein 1 (HSF1) and SIRT1 were examined in rats with MDD and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in a Caco-2 cell model with stable expression of transcobalamin-oleosin (TO) chimera, which impairs cellular availability of vitamin B12, and in IBD. The effects of SIRT1 activation were studied both in vitro and in vivo.
MDD aggravated DSS-induced colitis clinically, endoscopically and histologically. MDD activated ER stress pathways, with increased phosphorylate-PKR-like ER kinase, P-eiF-2Î±, P-IRE-1Î±, activating transcription factor (ATF)6, XBP1-S protein and ATF4 mRNA expression levels in rats. This was accompanied by reduced SIRT1 expression level and greater acetylation of HSF1, in relation with a dramatic decrease of chaperones (binding immunoglobulin protein (BIP), heat shock protein (HSP)27 and HSP90). Adding either vitamin B12, S-adenosylmethionine or an SIRT1 activator (SRT1720) reduced the UPR in vitro. In rats, SIRT1 activation by SRT1720 prevented colitis by reducing HSF1 acetylation and increasing expression of BIP, HSP27 and HSP90.

The reduction in SIRT1 expression and the subsequent increase in HSF1 acetylation, along with a decrease in chaperones such as BIP, HSP27, and HSP90, further support this conclusion. The study also suggests that vitamin B12, S-adenosylmethionine, or an SIRT1 activator (SRT1720) can reduce the UPR both in vitro and in vivo, providing potential therapeutic strategies for managing colitis associated with MDD. The study also indicates impaired expression of SIRT1 in the colonic epithelium of patients with IBD.","Methyl donor deficiency (MDD) aggravates experimental colitis in rats and increases endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress through decreased sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in neuronal cells and myocardium. ER stress plays a key role in IBD pathogenesis.
We investigated whether the influence of MDD on colitis resulted from an ER stress response triggered by decreased SIRT1 expression.
The unfolded protein response (UPR), chaperones proteins, heat shock factor protein 1 (HSF1) and SIRT1 were examined in rats with MDD and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in a Caco-2 cell model with stable expression of transcobalamin-oleosin (TO) chimera, which impairs cellular availability of vitamin B12, and in IBD. The effects of SIRT1 activation were studied both in vitro and in vivo.
MDD aggravated DSS-induced colitis clinically, endoscopically and histologically. MDD activated ER stress pathways, with increased phosphorylate-PKR-like ER kinase, P-eiF-2Î±, P-IRE-1Î±, activating transcription factor (ATF)6, XBP1-S protein and ATF4 mRNA expression levels in rats. This was accompanied by reduced SIRT1 expression level and greater acetylation of HSF1, in relation with a dramatic decrease of chaperones (binding immunoglobulin protein (BIP), heat shock protein (HSP)27 and HSP90). Adding either vitamin B12, S-adenosylmethionine or an SIRT1 activator (SRT1720) reduced the UPR in vitro. In rats, SIRT1 activation by SRT1720 prevented colitis by reducing HSF1 acetylation and increasing expression of BIP, HSP27 and HSP90. Immunohistochemistry showed impaired expression of SIRT1 in the colonic epithelium of patients with IBD."

This is because the mutated enzymes have reduced activity, leading to an imbalance in protein synthesis when the corresponding amino acids are not available. The supplementation of these amino acids prevents apoptosis, and inhibitors like cycloheximide can delay but not completely prevent apoptosis at higher temperatures.","We have isolated a series of temperature-sensitive mutants for cell-proliferation from the BHK21 cell line derived from the golden hamster (Nishimoto & Basilico 1978; Nishimoto et al. 1982).

Pentobarbital-anesthetized New Zealand White rabbits were subjected to 30 min of coronary artery occlusion followed by 3 h of reperfusion and were randomly assigned to receive vehicle (control), 1.0 minimum alveolar concentration of desflurane, esmolol (30 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1)) for the initial 30 min of reperfusion or throughout reperfusion, the beta2-adrenergic receptor blocker ICI 118,551 (0.2 mg/kg), the protein kinase A inhibitor H-89 (250 microg/kg), or the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II inhibitor KN-93 (300 microg/kg) in the presence or absence of desflurane. Protein expression of protein kinase B, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, and phospholamban was measured by Western immunoblotting. Myocardial infarct size was assessed by triphenyltetrazolium staining.
Infarct size was 57 +/- 5% in control. Desflurane postconditioning reduced infarct size to 36 +/- 5%. Esmolol given during the initial 30 min of reperfusion had no effect on infarct size (54 +/- 4%) but blocked desflurane-induced postconditioning (58 +/- 5%), whereas esmolol administered throughout reperfusion reduced infarct size in the absence or presence of desflurane to 42 +/- 6% and 41 +/- 7%, respectively. ICI 118,551 and KN-93 did not affect infarct size (62 +/- 4% and 62 +/- 6%, respectively) but abolished desflurane-induced postconditioning (57 +/- 5% and 64 +/- 3%, respectively).

Further, expression of inflammatory marker proteins such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î±, and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 was increased in the WT-EIU mouse eyes but not in the ARKO-EIU eyes. The T cells proliferated vigorously when exposed to the hIRPB antigen in vitro and secreted various cytokines and chemokines, which were significantly inhibited in the T cells isolated from the ARKO mice."

Increased posterior-inferior directed slope of the medial and lateral tibial plateaus are associated with increased risk of suffering a noncontact ACL injury.
Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3.
In sum, 176 athletes competing in organized sports at the college and high school levels participated in the study: 88 suffering their first noncontact ACL injury and 88 matched controls. Magnetic resonance images were acquired, and geometry of the subchondral bone portion of the tibial plateau was characterized on each athlete bilaterally by measuring the medial and lateral tibial plateau slopes, coronal tibial slope, and the depth of the medial tibial plateau. Comparisons between knees of the same person were made with paired t tests, and associations with injury risk were assessed by conditional logistic regression analysis of ACL-injured and control participants.
Controls exhibited side-to-side symmetry of subchondral bone geometry, while the ACL-injured athletes did not, suggesting that the ACL injury may have changed the subchondral bone geometry. Therefore, the uninjured knees of the ACL-injured athletes and the corresponding limbs of their matched controls were used to assess associations with injury risk.

1963,24343768,"Children and adolescents with femoral fractures are almost always admitted to hospital. They invariably start their hospital experience in the Emergency Department, often requiring transfer to a specialist children's hospital. They require analgesia or anaesthesia so that radiographs can be obtained and for management of their fractures. The initial care process involves from two to six transfers from stretcher to stretcher/imaging/operating-suite table or hospital bed within the first few hours, so prompt pain relief is essential. Systemic analgesia can be provided orally or parenterally. Alternatively, a nerve block may be used where local anaesthetic is injected around a nerve to block sensation or freeze the involved area.
To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of femoral nerve block (FNB) or fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB) for initial pain management of children with fractures of the femur (thigh bone) in the pre-hospital or in-hospital emergency setting, with or without systemic analgesia.
We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (11 January 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2012 Issue 12), MEDLINE (1946 to January Week 1 2013), EMBASE (1980 to 2013 Week 01), Google Scholar (31 January 2013) and trial registries (31 January 2013). We handsearched recent issues of specialist journals and references of relevant articles.
Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials assessing the effects of FNB or FICBÂ for initial pain management compared with systemic opiates in children (aged under 18 years) with fractures of the femur receiving pre-hospital or in hospital emergency care. Primary outcomes included failure of analgesia at 30 minutes, pain levels during procedures and transfers (e.g. to a stretcher or hospital ward) for up to eight hours, and adverse effects.
Two review authors independently extracted data using a pre-piloted form. Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias for the included study and assessed quality of the evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach; i.e. as very low, low, moderate or high. Meta-analysis of results was not possible as we found only one trial that could be included in the review.
We included one randomised trial of 55 children aged between 16 months to 15 years. It compared anatomically-guided FICB versus systemic analgesia with intravenous morphine sulphate. The small sample size and the high risk of bias relating to lack of blinding resulted in a low quality rating for all outcomes.Overall, the trial provided low quality evidence for better pain management in the FICB group. Fewer children in the FICB group had analgesia failure at 30 minutes than in the morphine group (2/26 (8%) versus 8/28 (29%); risk ratio (RR) 0.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09 to 1.20; P value 0.09). The trial did not report on pain during procedures or transfers, or application of analgesia. The trial provided low quality evidence that FICB has a better safety profile than morphine, with only four (15%) reports of redness and pain at the injection site, and no reports of the type of adverse effects of systematic analgesia that occurred in the morphine group, such as respiratory depression (six cases (21%)) and vomiting (four cases (14%)). No long-term adverse events were reported for either intervention. Clinically significant pain relief was achieved in both groups at five minutes; with limited evidence of greater initial pain relief in the FICB group. Based on an inspection of graphically-presented data, at least 46% (12/26) of children in the FICB group had no supplementary medication (mainly analgesia) for the six hours of the study, while only 5% (1 or 2/28) of children in the intravenous morphine group went without additional analgesia. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether child or parental satisfaction with the method of analgesia favoured either method. Resource use was not measured.",Does nerve block for initial pain management of femoral fractures in children?,Yes. Low quality evidence from one small trial suggests that FICB provides better and longer lasting pain relief with fewer adverse events than intravenous opioids for femur fractures in children.

However, the study included was small and had a high risk of bias, so more research is needed to confirm these findings. The review did not find enough evidence to determine whether child or parental satisfaction with the method of analgesia favored either method, or whether there were differences in resource use between the two interventions.","Children and adolescents with femoral fractures are almost always admitted to hospital. They invariably start their hospital experience in the Emergency Department, often requiring transfer to a specialist children's hospital. They require analgesia or anaesthesia so that radiographs can be obtained and for management of their fractures. The initial care process involves from two to six transfers from stretcher to stretcher/imaging/operating-suite table or hospital bed within the first few hours, so prompt pain relief is essential. Systemic analgesia can be provided orally or parenterally. Alternatively, a nerve block may be used where local anaesthetic is injected around a nerve to block sensation or freeze the involved area.
To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of femoral nerve block (FNB) or fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB) for initial pain management of children with fractures of the femur (thigh bone) in the pre-hospital or in-hospital emergency setting, with or without systemic analgesia.
We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (11 January 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2012 Issue 12), MEDLINE (1946 to January Week 1 2013), EMBASE (1980 to 2013 Week 01), Google Scholar (31 January 2013) and trial registries (31 January 2013). We handsearched recent issues of specialist journals and references of relevant articles.
Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials assessing the effects of FNB or FICBÂ for initial pain management compared with systemic opiates in children (aged under 18 years) with fractures of the femur receiving pre-hospital or in hospital emergency care. Primary outcomes included failure of analgesia at 30 minutes, pain levels during procedures and transfers (e.g. to a stretcher or hospital ward) for up to eight hours, and adverse effects.
Two review authors independently extracted data using a pre-piloted form. Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias for the included study and assessed quality of the evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach; i.e. as very low, low, moderate or high. Meta-analysis of results was not possible as we found only one trial that could be included in the review.
We included one randomised trial of 55 children aged between 16 months to 15 years. It compared anatomically-guided FICB versus systemic analgesia with intravenous morphine sulphate. The small sample size and the high risk of bias relating to lack of blinding resulted in a low quality rating for all outcomes.Overall, the trial provided low quality evidence for better pain management in the FICB group. Fewer children in the FICB group had analgesia failure at 30 minutes than in the morphine group (2/26 (8%) versus 8/28 (29%); risk ratio (RR) 0.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09 to 1.20; P value 0.09). The trial did not report on pain during procedures or transfers, or application of analgesia. The trial provided low quality evidence that FICB has a better safety profile than morphine, with only four (15%) reports of redness and pain at the injection site, and no reports of the type of adverse effects of systematic analgesia that occurred in the morphine group, such as respiratory depression (six cases (21%)) and vomiting (four cases (14%)). No long-term adverse events were reported for either intervention. Clinically significant pain relief was achieved in both groups at five minutes; with limited evidence of greater initial pain relief in the FICB group. Based on an inspection of graphically-presented data, at least 46% (12/26) of children in the FICB group had no supplementary medication (mainly analgesia) for the six hours of the study, while only 5% (1 or 2/28) of children in the intravenous morphine group went without additional analgesia. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether child or parental satisfaction with the method of analgesia favoured either method. Resource use was not measured."

Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive multinucleated cells were considered as osteoclasts, and the resorption area was determined by incubating the cells on dentine discs. The intracellular cAMP level was determined using a direct enzyme immunoassay. Signaling pathways were investigated using western blot and RT-PCR. Recombinant afamin was administered exogenously to bone cell cultures.
Afamin stimulated both osteoclastogenesis and in vitro bone resorption. Consistently, the expressions of osteoclast differentiation markers were significantly increased by afamin. Although afamin mainly affected the late-differentiation stages of osteoclastogenesis, the expression levels of receptor activator of nuclear factor-ÎºB ligand (RANKL)-dependent signals were not changed. Afamin markedly decreased the levels of intracellular cAMP with reversal by pretreatment with pertussis toxin (PTX), a specific inhibitor of Gi-coupled receptor signaling. In addition, PTX almost completely blocked afamin-stimulated osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, pretreatment with KN93 and STO609 - Ca2+/cal - mo dulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) and CaMK kinase inhibitors, respectively - significantly prevented decreases in the intracellular cAMP level by afamin while attenuating afamin-stimulated osteoclastogenesis.",Does afamin stimulate osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption via Gi-coupled receptor and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ( CaMK ) pathways?,Yes.

For every point increase in EF score (that is, worsening EF) the odds of not receiving NS during surgery do not increase significantly. Although NS is not associated with worse cancer outcomes in appropriately selected patients, failure to spare nerves is associated with poor post-operative EF, urinary continence, and increased severity of cavernous venous leak. Patient anxiety related to cancer diagnosis and impending treatment may lead to falsely-worsened apparent EF when recent erections are assessed during a pre-operative planning visit.

This chronic inflammatory disorder results from aberrant host immune responses to subsets of the gut microbiota, and is characterized by intense neutrophil recruitment to the lamina propria, surface and crypt epithelium. Importantly, adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) is abundant in ileal biopsies, highlighting a possible etiological role. In this study, we investigated the impact of antibiotics and AIEC challenge on murine intestinal dysbiosis and neutrophil extracellular trap activation, which is a critical component of the neutrophil antimicrobial repertoire.
Male C57BL/6 mice were administered vancomycin and gentamicin (once daily, 3 days), and subsequently challenged with AIEC strain LF82 (once daily, 2 days). Perturbation of the gut microbiota was monitored using a combination of molecular and phylogenetic analyses. The impact of commensal and dysbiotic gut bacterial communities on neutrophil extracellular trap mobilization and intestinal redox balance was also quantified.
Exposure of neutrophils to murine commensal gut microbial communities activated neutrophil extracellular trap formation. The capacity of neutrophils to cast these web-like structures was exacerbated following antibiotic and AIEC-associated intestinal dysbiosis, highlighting the possible overgrowth of immune-activating intestinal pathobionts.

The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for being a statin user before the index date was 1.28 among cases compared to controls. This suggests that individuals who had used statins were more likely to develop HZ than those who did not use statins. Additionally, subjects aged 18-44 years had the highest adjusted OR for prior statin use among cases compared to controls (OR: 1.69). The study also found that both regular and irregular statin users before the index date had a higher likelihood of developing HZ compared to non-users.","This study investigated the association between statin use and herpes zoster (HZ) occurrence in a population-based case-control study.
Study subjects were retrieved from the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000. This study included 47,359 cases with HZ and 142,077 controls. We performed conditional logistic regression analyses to calculate the odds ratio (OR) to present the association between HZ and having previously been prescribed statin.
We found that 13.0% of the sampled subjects had used statins, at 15.5% and 12.1% for cases and controls, respectively (p<0.001). A conditional logistic regression analysis suggested that the adjusted OR of being a statin user before the index date for cases was 1.28 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.24âˆ¼1.32) compared to controls. Subjects aged 18âˆ¼44 years had the highest adjusted OR for prior statin use among cases compared to controls (OR: 1.69; 95% CI: 1.45âˆ¼1.92). Furthermore, we found that the ORs of being a regular and irregular statin user before the index date for cases were 1.32 (95% CI: 1.27âˆ¼1.38) and 1.23 (95% CI: 1.181.29), respectively, compared to controls."
1999,26346825,"Finding inexpensive and reliable techniques for assessing skin colour is important, given that it is related to several adverse human health outcomes. Visual observation is considered a subjective approach assessment and, even when made by trained assessor, concern has been raised about the need for controlled lighting in the study venue. The aim of this study is to determine whether visual skin colour assessments correlate with objective skin colour measurements in study venues with different lighting types and configurations.
Two trained investigators, with confirmed visual acuity, visually classified the inner, upper arm skin colour of 556 adults using Munsell(Â®) colour classifications converted to Individual Typology Angle (Â°ITA) values based on published data. Skin colour at the same anatomic site was also measured using a colorimeter. Each participant was assessed in one of 10 different buildings, each with a different study day. Munsell(Â®) -derived Â°ITA values were compared to colorimeter Â°ITA values for the full sample and by building/day.
We found a strong positive, monotonic correlation between Munsell(Â®) derived Â°ITA values and colorimeter Â°ITA values for all participants (Spearman ÏÂ =Â 0.8585, PÂ <Â 0.001). Similar relationships were found when Munsell(Â®) and colorimeter Â°ITA values were compared for participants assessed in the same building for all 10 buildings (Spearman Ï values ranged from 0.797 to 0.934, all correlations were statistically significant at PÂ <Â 0.001).","Is in multiple situational light settings , visual observation for skin colour assessment comparable with colorimeter measurement?",No. It is not possible to visually assess individual skin colour in multiple situational lighting settings and retrieve results that are comparable with objective measurements of skin colour. This was true for individuals of varying population groups and skin pigmentation.,FAIL,pubmedQA," Yes, visual observation for skin color assessment in multiple situational light settings is comparable with colorimeter measurement, as shown by the strong positive correlation found between Munsell-derived Individual Typology Angle (°ITA) values and colorimeter °ITA values. This correlation was consistent across different buildings and study days.","Finding inexpensive and reliable techniques for assessing skin colour is important, given that it is related to several adverse human health outcomes.
