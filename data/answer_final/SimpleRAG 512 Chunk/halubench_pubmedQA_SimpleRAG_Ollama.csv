1000,25985014,"We investigated the role of surgical ablation targeting the autonomous nervous system during a Cox-Maze IV procedure in the maintenance of sinus rhythm at long-term follow-up.
The patient population consisted of 519 subjects with persistent or long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) undergoing radiofrequency Maze IV during open heart surgery between January 2006 and July 2013 at three institutions without (Group 1) or with (Group 2) ganglionated plexi (GP) ablation. Recurrence of atrial fibrillation off-antiarrhythmic drugs was the primary outcome. Predictors of AF recurrence were evaluated by means of competing risk regression. Median follow-up was 36.7 months.
The percentage of patients in normal sinus rhythm (NSR) off-antiarrhythmic drugs did not differ between groups (Group 1-75.5%, Group 2-67.8%, p = 0.08). Duration of AF â‰¥ 38 months (p = 0.01), left atrial diameter â‰¥ 54 mm (0.001), left atrial area â‰¥ 33 cm(2) (p = 0.005), absence of connecting lesions (p= 0.04), and absence of right atrial ablation (p<0.001) were independently associated with high incidence of AF recurrence. In contrast the absence of GP ablation was not a significant factor (p = 0.12).",Is ganglionated plexi ablation during Maze IV procedure beneficial for postoperative long-term stable sinus rhythm?,No. GP ablation did not prove to be beneficial for postoperative stable NSR. A complete left atrial lesion set and biatrial ablation are advisable for improving rhythm outcomes.

1001,16195477,"Obesity is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Although it is known that white adipose tissue (WAT) produces numerous proinflammatory and proatherogenic cytokines and chemokines, it is unclear whether adipose-derived chemotactic signals affect the chronic inflammation in atherosclerosis.
Histological examination showed that perivascular WAT (pWAT) is in close proximity to vascular walls, particularly at sites that have a tendency to develop atherosclerosis. In rodents, the amount of pWAT is markedly increased by a high-fat diet. At a functional level, supernatant from subcutaneous and pWAT strongly induced the chemotaxis of peripheral blood leukocytes. The migration of granulocytes and monocytes was mostly mediated by interleukin-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, respectively, whereas both chemokines contributed to the migration of activated T cells. Moreover, pWAT produces these chemokines, as shown by immunohistochemistry and by explant culture. The accumulation of macrophages and T cells at the interface between pWAT and the adventitia of human atherosclerotic aortas may reflect this prochemotactic activity of pWAT.",Production of chemokines by perivascular adipose tissue: a role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis?,"Yes. Human pWAT has chemotactic properties through the secretion of different chemokines, and we propose that pWAT might contribute to the progression of obesity-associated atherosclerosis.",PASS,pubmedQA," Redox signalling since p38 inhibition mimics effects of N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), but NAC does not affect H5N1-induced cytokine/chemokine expression, so its role in the production of chemokines by perivascular adipose tissue in atherosclerosis is unclear based on this information.","redox signalling since p38 inhibition had been shown before to mimick effects of the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) [34] .

However, the duration of anti-tuberculous therapy has not been clarified in intestinal tuberculosis.AIM: To compare the efficacy of different treatment durations in tuberculous enterocolitis in terms of response and recurrence rates.
Forty patients with tuberculous enterocolitis were randomized prospectively: 22 patients into a 9-month and 18 into a 15-month group. Diagnosis was made either by colonoscopic findings of discrete ulcers and histopathological findings of caseating granuloma and/or acid-fast bacilli, or by clinical improvement after therapeutic trial. Patients were followed up with colonoscopy every other month until complete response or treatment completion, and then every 6 months for 1 year and annually. Complete response was defined as a resolution of symptoms and active tuberculosis by colonoscopy.
Complete response was obtained in all patients in both groups. Two patients in the 9-month group and one in the 15-month group underwent operation due to intestinal obstruction and perianal fistula, respectively. No recurrence of active intestinal tuberculosis occurred during the follow-up period in either group.",Is a 9-month treatment sufficient in tuberculous enterocolitis?,Yes.

1003,20594006,"Tethering of the spinal cord is thought to increase the chance of neurological injury when scoliosis correction is undertaken. All patients with myelomeningocele (MM) are radiographically tethered, and untethering procedures carry significant morbidity risks including worsening neurological function and wound complications. No guidelines exist as regards untethering in patients with MM prior to scoliosis correction surgery. The authors' aim in this study was to evaluate their experience in patients with MM who were not untethered before scoliosis correction.
Seventeen patients with MM were retrospectively identified and 1) had no evidence of a clinically symptomatic tethered cord, 2) had undergone spinal fusion for scoliosis correction, and 3) had not been untethered for at least 1 year prior to surgery. The minimum follow-up after fusion was 2 years. Charts and radiographs were reviewed for neurological or shunt complications in the perioperative period.
The average age of the patients was 12.4 years, and the following neurological levels were affected: T-12 and above, 7 patients; L-1/L-2, 6 patients; L-3, 2 patients; and L-4, 2 patients. All were radiographically tethered as confirmed on MR imaging. Fourteen of the patients (82%) had a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. The mean Cobb angle was corrected from 82 degrees to 35 degrees , for a 57% correction. All patients underwent neuromonitoring of their upper extremities, and some underwent lower extremity monitoring as well. Postoperatively, no patient experienced a new cranial nerve palsy, shunt malfunction, change in urological function, or upper extremity weakness/sensory loss. One patient had transient lower extremity weakness, which returned to baseline within 1 month of surgery.",A patient with myelomeningocele: is untethering necessary prior to scoliosis correction?,"No. The study results suggested that spinal cord untethering may be unnecessary in patients with MM who are undergoing scoliosis corrective surgery and do not present with clinical symptoms of a tethered cord, even though tethering is radiographically demonstrated.",PASS,pubmedQA," I don't have real-time access to medical databases, but in general, the necessity of untethered release (untethering) before scoliosis correction in a patient with myelomeningocele may depend on the specific case and its associated complications.

1008,9142039,"To assess the relationship between the experience of pediatric housestaff and tests ordered on infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (ICU).
Prospective, cohort study over one full academic year.
One academic Level III neonatal intensive care nursery.
Data were collected prospectively on all 785 infants admitted to the neonatal ICU from July 1993 to June 1994. These infants were cared for by 14 different categorical pediatric housestaff.
Our neonatal ICU has either a resident or an intern on-call by himself/herself at night, affording us a natural setting to compare intern vs. resident test ordering. The outcomes of interest were number of arterial blood gases, radiographs, and electrolytes ordered per infant by the on-call pediatric houseofficer, as tabulated the morning after the call night. Control variables included the severity-of-illness of the individual infant (using the Neonatal Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System), the workload of the houseofficer (number of patients, number of admissions), and supervision (rounding frequency and on-call attending). Controlling for the severity-of-illness of the infant, the workload on the call night, and supervision with multiple linear regression, we found that interns ordered significantly (p = .02) greater numbers of arterial blood gases per infant than residents, amounting to some 0.33 blood gases per infant per call night (3.22 vs. 2.89 arterial blood gases per infant per night). This increase of 0.33 blood gases per infant amounts to interns ordering $169 more arterial blood gases per call night at our institution. There was no difference between interns and residents in ordering radiographs or electrolytes.",Does pediatric housestaff experience influence tests ordered for infants in the neonatal intensive care unit?,"Yes.

Mammographic density was determined both by breast imaging-reporting and data system (BI-RADS) classification and by an automated software program (Volpara Solutions). Additional margins were deemed unnecessary if the lumpectomy specimen margin was free of invasive tumor [â‰¥2 mm for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)] or if further re-excision was needed.
Of 655 patients, 398 (60.8%) had BCS, whereas 226 (34.5%) underwent initial mastectomy. The women with denser breasts (BI-RADS 3 or 4) underwent initial mastectomy more frequently than the women with less dense breasts (40.0 vs. 30.5%, respectively; p = 0.0118). Of the patients with BCS, 166 (41.7%) required separate re-excision. Additional margins were taken during BCS in 192 (48.2%) patients, with 151 (78.6%) proving to be unnecessary. In the bivariable analysis, the patients with denser breasts according to BI-RADS classification and volumetric density showed a trend toward requiring more frequent re-excision, but this association was not seen in the multivariable analysis. The rate of unnecessary margins did not differ by breast density. In the multivariate analysis, the re-excision rates increased with DCIS (p<0.0003) and decreased with resection of additional margins (p = 0.0043).",Does Mammographic Density have an Impact on the Margin Re-excision Rate After Breast-Conserving Surgery?,No. Mammographic density is not associated with an increased need for re-excision or resection of unnecessary margins at initial BCS.,PASS,pubmedQA," Yes, higher mammographic density is associated with a higher margin re-excision rate after breast-conserving surgery.","rate) or an explicit estimation of the actual reporting rate.

Twenty-eight patients suffering from ET (10 males plus 18 females) and 28 NV (12 males and 16 females) were enroled in this study. In addition, 33 patients (11 males and 22 females) with an established diagnosis of PD with unilateral limb involvement (12 left hemi-body and 21 right hemi-body) were included for comparison with ET. We used DaTSCAN to obtain SPECT images and measure the radiopharmaceutical uptake in the striatum (S), as well as the caudate nucleus (CN) and putamen (P) in all individuals.
Qualitative (Visual) interpretation of the SPECT data did not find any difference in the uptake of the radiopharmaceutical at the level of the S, CN and P between NV and ET patients. Reduced accumulation of the radiopharmaceutical uptake was found in the P of all PD patients. Semiquantitative analysis revealed significant differences between NV and ET patients in the striatum, reduced in the latter. There was also a significant reduction in the tracer accumulation in the left putamen of patients with right hemi-parkinsonism compared to ET and NV. Patients with left hemi-parkinsonism, demonstrated reduced radioligand uptake in the right putamen in comparison with ET and NV. Clinical follow-up of 20 patients with ET at (so many months afterwards) revealed no significant change in clinical presentation, particularly no signs of PD.

It is a biological parameter that is easily, precisely and relatively cheaply measured. The epidemiological features of serum chloride levels have not been studied before.
For the random sample of men and women from the Belgian Interuniversity Research on Nutrition and Health aged 25-74 years, free of symptomatic coronary heart disease at baseline, serum chloride concentrations were measured, among those of other electrolytes. The cohort was followed up for 10 years with respect to subsequent cause-specific mortality.

Grade of employment was a strong predictor of mortality before retirement. For men dying at ages 40-64 the lowest employment grade had 3.12 times the mortality of the highest grade (95% confidence interval 2.4 to 4.1). After retirement the ability of grade to predict mortality declined (rate ratio 1.86; 1.6 to 2.2). A non-work based measure of socioeconomic status (car ownership) predicted mortality less well than employment grade before retirement but its ability to predict mortality declined less after retirement. Using a relative index of inequality that was sensitive to the distribution among socioeconomic groups showed employment grade and car ownership to have independent associations with mortality that were of equal magnitude after retirement.

Obesity is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Although it is known that white adipose tissue (WAT) produces numerous proinflammatory and proatherogenic cytokines and chemokines, it is unclear whether adipose-derived chemotactic signals affect the chronic inflammation in atherosclerosis.

Histological examination showed that perivascular WAT (pWAT) is in close proximity to vascular walls, particularly at sites that have a tendency to develop atherosclerosis. In rodents, the amount of pWAT is markedly increased by a high-fat diet. At a functional level, supernatant from subcutaneous and pWAT strongly induced the chemotaxis of peripheral blood leukocytes.

One hundred patients with advanced or recurrent CRC were enrolled. RNA extracted from FFPE tissues was subjected to gene-expression microarray analysis.
The patients were stratified into four subgroups (subtypes A1, A2, B1, and B2) by unsupervised hierarchical clustering. By use of principle-components analysis (PCA), the patients were divided into subtypes A and B on the basis of component 1 and into subtypes 1 and 2 on the basis of component 2. Subtype A was significantly enriched among patients without the KRAS mutation and with an earlier clinical stage at diagnosis.

This is a prospective study in tertiary care centre. Consecutive healthy pregnant women (12-16 weeks gestation) were enrolled. Serum 25(OH) vitamin-D was estimated, and levels <20 ng ml(-1) were considered as VDD. Risk factors and clinical features of VDD were assessed. Gallbladder ejection fraction (GBEF) was assessed by ultrasound after a standard fatty meal, and <40 % was defined as stasis. Statistical analysis was performed to assess relationship of GB stasis and vitamin-D levels and identify factors associated with VDD.

We over-expressed DREF in the wing imaginal disc using a GAL4-UAS targeted expression system in Drosophila. Over-expression of DREF induced a notching wing phenotype, which was associated with ectopic apoptosis. A half reduction of the reaper, head involution defective and grim gene dose suppressed this DREF-induced notching wing phenotype. Furthermore, this was also the case with co-expression of baculovirus P35, a caspase inhibitor. In addition, over-expression of the 32 kDa boundary element-associated factor (BEAF-32), thought to compete against DREF for common binding sites in genomic regions, rescued the DREF-induced notching wing phenotype, while a half reduction of the genomic region, including the BEAF-32 gene, exerted enhancing effects.

1105,25472866,"Olive cultivation blends with the history of the Mediterranean countries since ancient times. Even today, activities around the olive tree constitute major engagements of several people in the countryside of both sides of the Mediterranean basin. The olive fly is, beyond doubt, the most destructive pest of cultivated olives. The female fly leaves its eggs in the olive fruit. Upon emergence, the larvae feed on the olive sap, thus destroying the fruit. If untreated, practically all olives get infected. The use of chemical insecticides constitutes the principal olive fly control approach. The Sterile Insect Technique (SIT), an environmentally friendly alternative control method, had been tried in pilot field applications in the 1970's, albeit with no practical success. This was mainly attributed to the low, non-antagonistic quality of the mixed-sex released insects. Many years of experience from successful SIT applications in related species, primarily the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata, demonstrated that efficient SIT protocols require the availability of fundamental genetic and molecular information.
Among the primary systems whose understanding can contribute towards novel SIT approaches (or its recently developed alternative RIDL: Release of Insects carrying a Dominant Lethal) is the reproductive, since the ability to manipulate the reproductive system would directly affect the insect's fertility. In addition, the analysis of early embryonic promoters and apoptotic genes would provide tools that confer dominant early-embryonic lethality during mass-rearing. Here we report the identification of several genes involved in these systems through whole transcriptome analysis of female accessory glands (FAGs) and spermathecae, as well as male testes. Indeed, analysis of differentially expressed genes in these tissues revealed higher metabolic activity in testes than in FAGs/spermathecae. Furthermore, at least five olfactory-related genes were shown to be differentially expressed in the female and male reproductive systems analyzed. Finally, the expression profile of the embryonic serendipity-Î± locus and the pre-apoptotic head involution defective gene were analyzed during embryonic developmental stages.",Does the molecular biology of the olive fly come of age?,"Yes.

The maxillary first molar of 20 male mice was moved toward the palatal side by a nickel-titanium super elastic wire for 1 to 14Â days, and the bone remodeling around the root was evaluated using histomorphometry and immunodetection of bone-restricted Ifitm-like (Bril) protein, a novel marker of active bone formation.
When mechanical stress was applied to the tooth, the periodontal ligament on the palatal side was immediately compressed to approximately half of its original width by the tipping movement of the tooth. At the same time, osteoblasts deposited new bone on the wall of the maxillary sinus prior to bone resorption by osteoclasts on the periodontal side, as evidenced by the high level of expression of Bril at this site. As a result of these sequential processes, bone on the sinus side maintained a consistent thickness during the entire observation period. No root resorption was observed.",Does mechanical stress induce bone formation in the maxillary sinus in a short-term mouse model?,"Yes.

To understand why MiHA-targeted T cells have such a potent antitumor effect it is essential to evaluate their in vivo behavior. In the present work, we therefore addressed two specific questions: what is the proliferative dynamics of H7(a)-specifc T cells in tumors, and do H7(a)-specific T cells persist long-term after adoptive transfer?
By day 3 after adoptive transfer, we observed a selective infiltration of melanomas by anti-H7(a) T cells. Over the next five days, anti-H7(a) T cells expanded massively in the tumor but not in the spleen. Thus, by day 8 after injection, anti-H7(a) T cells in the tumor had undergone more cell divisions than those in the spleen. These data strongly suggest that anti-H7(a) T cells proliferate preferentially and extensively in the tumors. We also found that two host factors regulated long-term persistence of anti-H7(a) memory T cells: thymic function and expression of H7(a) by host cells. On day 100, anti-H7(a) memory T cells were abundant in euthymic H7(a)-negative (B10.H7(b)) mice, present in low numbers in thymectomized H7(a)-positive (B10) hosts, and undetectable in euthymic H7(a)-positive recipients.",Do two host factors regulate persistence of H7-specific T cells injected in tumor-bearing mice?,"Yes. Although in general the tumor environment is not propitious to T-cell invasion and expansion, the present work shows that this limitation may be overcome by adoptive transfer of primed CD8 T cells targeted to an immunodominant MiHA (here H7(a)). At least in some cases, prolonged persistence of adoptively transferred T cells may be valuable for prevention of late cancer relapse in adoptive hosts. Our findings therefore suggest that it may be advantageous to target MiHAs with a restricted tissue distribution in order to promote persistence of memory T cells and thereby minimize the risk of cancer recurrence.",PASS,pubmedQA," No, the provided context does not mention any regulation of persistence of H7-specific T cells by NF-kB or TNF.","The aim of this study was to explore the efficacy and define mechanisms of action of PRIMA-1(MET) as a TP53 targeted therapy in soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) cells.

All experiments were performed in parallel on aortas from 20-wk-old SHR and Wistar-Kyoto normotensive rats (WKY). Rings, with or without endothelium, were suspended in conventional organ chambers for the recording of changes in isometric force. The expression of PGH synthase-1 was evaluated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis.
Under control conditions acetylcholine did not cause contractions of rings with or without endothelium. However, in the presence of nitro-L-arginine (NLA, an inhibitor of nitric-oxide synthase), it evoked endothelium-dependent contraction in the SHR but not in the WKY aortas. The expression of PGH synthase-1 was comparable in the aortas of both strains (with and without endothelium). PGH2 caused greater contractions in rings without endothelium from the SHR than those from WKY, while U46,619 evoked a comparable response, in aortas from both strains.",Does increased response to prostaglandin H2 precede changes in PGH synthase-1 expression in the SHR aorta?,"Yes.

Although it is speculated that LPA might play a role in pathophysiologic processes in vivo, not only its role but also even a possible alteration in its blood concentration under specific diseases is essentially unknown. Autotaxin (ATX), originally purified as an autocrine motility factor for melanoma cells, was revealed to be a key enzyme in LPA synthesis. We determined LPA and ATX levels in the blood of patients with liver disease.
ATX activity was measured by determining choline with the substrate of lysophosphatidylcholine, and the LPA level by an enzymatic cycling method in 41 patients with chronic hepatitis C.
The serum ATX activity and plasma LPA level were significantly increased in patients, and were correlated positively with serum hyaluronic acid, and negatively with platelets, albumin, and prothrombin time. The plasma LPA level was strongly correlated with serum ATX activity.

Moreover, cyanide has the potential to be used by terrorists, particularly in a closed space such as an airport or train station. Current therapies for cyanide poisoning must be given by intravenous administration, limiting their use in treating mass casualties.
We are developing two new cyanide antidotes--cobinamide, a vitamin B(12) analog, and sulfanegen, a 3-mercaptopyruvate prodrug. Both drugs can be given by intramuscular administration, and therefore could be used to treat a large number of people quickly. We now asked if the two drugs would have an augmented effect when combined.
We used a non-lethal and two different lethal models of cyanide poisoning in mice. The non-lethal model assesses neurologic recovery by quantitatively evaluating the innate righting reflex time of a mouse. The two lethal models are a cyanide injection and a cyanide inhalation model.
We found that the two drugs are at least additive when used together in both the non-lethal and lethal models: at doses where all animals died with either drug alone, the combination yielded 80 and 40% survival in the injection and inhalation models, respectively. Similarly, drug doses that yielded 40% survival with either drug alone, yielded 80 and 100% survival in the injection and inhalation models, respectively. As part of the inhalation model, we developed a new paradigm in which animals are exposed to cyanide gas, injected intramuscularly with an antidote, and then re-exposed to cyanide gas. This simulates cyanide exposure of a large number of people in a closed space, because people would remain exposed to cyanide, even after receiving an antidote.",Is the combination of cobinamide and sulfanegen highly effective in mouse models of cyanide poisoning?,Yes.

The pathogenesis involves oxidative stress, neutrophil infiltration, and inflammatory response. Platonin, a potent antioxidant, possesses potent anti-inflammation capacity. We sought to elucidate whether platonin could mitigate acute lung injury in a two-hit model of traumatic hemorrhage/resuscitation and subsequent endotoxemia.
Adult male rats were randomized to receive traumatic hemorrhage/resuscitation plus lipopolysaccharide (HS/L) alone or HS/L plus platonin (200 Î¼g/kg; n = 12 in each group). Sham groups were used simultaneously. At 6 hours after resuscitation, rats were killed and the levels of lung injury were assayed.
Rats treated with HS/L alone had severe lung injury as evidenced by significant alterations in lung function (i.e., arterial blood gas and alveolar-arterial oxygen difference) and histology. Significant increases in polymorphonuclear leukocytes/alveoli ratio (neutrophil infiltration index) and significant increases in the concentrations of inflammatory molecules (including chemokine, cytokine, and prostaglandin E2) and malondialdehyde (lipid peroxidation index) revealed that HS/L caused significant oxidative stress, neutrophil infiltration, and inflammatory response in rat lungs. Moreover, our data revealed that the levels of functional and histologic alteration as well as polymorphonuclear leukocytes/alveoli ratio and the concentrations of inflammatory molecules and malondialdehyde in rats treated with HS/L plus platonin (200 Î¼g/kg) were significantly lower than those treated with HR/L alone.",Does platonin mitigate lung injury in a two-hit model of hemorrhage/resuscitation and endotoxemia in rats?,Yes.

Farnsworth-Munsell (FM) 100-hue test was successfully administered before initiation of study treatment in each eye of 2701 of the 3711 ETDRS patients. Test results were converted into a Fourier series, classified by cluster analysis in the deferred-treatment group of eyes, and verified in the immediate-treatment group of eyes as separate samples.
Cluster analysis uncovered thirteen distinct patterns. Pattern A (51% or 1366 of the eyes) showed unimpaired hue discrimination and was comprised of younger patients with no or little macular edema. Pattern B eyes (10% or 262) showed generalized impairment of hue discrimination with no main axis defect. Patterns C (C1, C2, C3), comprising 26% (or 698) of the eyes, showed increasing severity of the yellow-blue diabetic retinopathy defect, associated with increasing mean age and increasing macular edema severity.

Blood transfusion is the commonest form of alloantigen pretreatment currently used in clinical practice. However, for recipients of organs from cadaver donors, it is not possible to predict the identity of the organ donor in advance. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that all the alloantigens expressed by a cadaver organ donor will be represented in the alloantigen pretreatment inoculum. We have previously shown that it is not necessary to expose the recipient to the full complement of donor alloantigens to induce long-term survival of a subsequent cardiac allograft. Here, we investigated the in vivo mechanism responsible for this phenomena.
Unresponsiveness to the mouse MHC class I molecule Kb was induced in CBA.Ca (H2k) recipients by administration of bone marrow cells from transgenic CBA mice, CBK (H2k + Kb) before transplantation of fully allogeneic and F1 vascularized cardiac allografts.
Pretreatment with CBK bone marrow cells resulted in the long-term survival of all cardiac allografts expressing H2-Kb. For example, C57BL/10 (H2b) and (CBKxBALB/c) F1 (H2k,d + Kb) cardiac allografts were accepted by recipients treated with CBK bone marrow cells before transplantation. In contrast, allografts that did not express Kb, such as BALB/c (H2d) or (CBAxBALB/c) F1 (H2k,d), were rejected acutely, with a median survival time (MST) of 7 and 6 days, respectively, in recipients treated with CBK bone marrow cells. Furthermore, when recipients pretreated with CBK bone marrow cells were grafted with a BALB/c heart and a CBK heart simultaneously, the BALB/c hearts were rejected (MST=10 days), whereas the CBK hearts were accepted. By contrast, in the maintenance phase (i.e., after transplantation), recipients with long-term surviving (CBKxBALB/c) F1 hearts (> 100 days) were found to accept BALB/c hearts indefinitely, whereas fourth-party B10.S (H2s) grafts were rejected (MST=7.5 days).

We estimated the concentration of 14 PCB congeners and 11 pesticides in maternal and cord blood samples and in breast milk in a population-based cohort of 400 mother-child pairs. At follow-up, we examined the children's ears and used their medical records to assess the OM occurrence and severity. Multivariate regression analyses were used with adjustments for passive smoking, crowding, dietary habits, parent's educational level, breast feeding and the use of child-care.
The children were 4-10 years of age at follow-up and 223 (85%) participated. We found no association between prenatal OC exposure and the development of OM. Factors associated with the child's hazard of OM during the first 4 years of life were: mother's history of OM (HR 1.70, 95% CI 1.11-2.59, p=0.01); mother's smoking habits: current (HR 2.47, 95% CI 1.45-4.21, p<0.01) and previous (HR 2.00, 95% CI 1.19-3.36, p<0.01); number of smokers in the home (HR 1.17, 95% CI 1.05-1.31, p<0.01).

Few studies have explored which of these factors are of particular importance in malnutrition in PD. The aim was to identify the determinants of nutritional status in people with Parkinson's disease (PWP).
Community-dwelling PWP (>18 years) were recruited (nâ€Š=â€Š125; 73M/52F; Mdn 70 years). Self-report assessments included Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI), Spielberger Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's disease-Autonomic (SCOPA-AUT), Modified Constipation Assessment Scale (MCAS) and Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (FOG-Q). Information about age, PD duration, medications, co-morbid conditions and living situation was obtained.

1135,27821059,"Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile pieces of genetic information with high mutagenic potential for the host genome. Transposition is often neutral or deleterious but may also generate potentially adaptive genetic variation. This additional source of variation could be especially relevant in non-recombining species reproducing asexually. However, evidence is lacking to determine the relevance of TEs in plant asexual genome evolution and their associated effects. Here, we characterize the repetitive fraction of the genome of the common dandelion, Taraxacum officinale and compare it between five accessions from the same apomictic lineage. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the extent of within-lineage divergence attributed to TE content and activity. We examined the repetitive genomic contribution, diversity, transcription and methylation changes to characterize accession-specific TEs.
Using low-coverage genomic sequencing, we report a highly heterogeneous TE compartment in the triploid apomict T. officinale representing up to 38.6Â % of the homoploid genome. The repetitive compartment is dominated by LTR retrotransposon families accompanied by few non-LTR retrotransposons and DNA transposons. Up to half of the repeat clusters are biased towards very high read identity, indicating recent and potentially ongoing activity of these TE families. Interestingly, the five accessions are divided into two main clades based on their TE composition. Clade 2 is more dynamic than clade 1 with higher abundance of Gypsy Chromovirus sequences and transposons. Furthermore, a few low-abundant genomic TE clusters exhibit high level of transcription in two of the accessions analysed. Using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing, we detected 18.9Â % of loci differentially methylated, of which 25.4 and 40.7Â % are annotated as TEs or functional genes, respectively. Additionally, we show clear evidence for accession-specific TE families that are differentially transcribed and differentially methylated within the apomictic lineage, including one Copia Ale II LTR element and a PIF-Harbinger DNA transposon.",Do recent and dynamic transposable elements contribute to genomic divergence under asexuality?,Yes. We report here a very young and dynamic repetitive compartment that enhances divergence within one asexual lineage of T. officinale.

1140,20950982,"Angioembolization is an effective adjunct to the management of retroperitoneal hemorrhage in pelvic fractures. Most patients with stable-type pelvic fracture are treated conservatively. However, in some stable pelvic fracture cases, patients should receive angioembolization for hemostasis upon incidental finding of contrast extravasation on computed tomography (CT). In this study, we attempted to define the characteristics of patients with stable pelvic fracture requiring angioembolization.
We retrospectively reviewed the charts of patients with pelvic fractures between January 2005 and November 2009. We focused on stable pelvic fracture patients with contrast extravasation on CT who then received angioembolization. The demographics, Injury Severity Score (ISS), Abbreviated Injury Scale score, and the blood glucose levels on admission were analyzed.
In total, 334 patients were enrolled. Patients with higher blood glucose level on admission with stable pelvic fracture had a higher rate of angioembolization. Furthermore, these patients presented with a higher Abbreviated Injury Scale score and ISS.",Is higher glucose on admission associated with need for angioembolization in stable pelvic fracture?,"Yes. In patients with stable pelvic fracture, higher blood glucose level on admission was associated with a higher likelihood of needing angioembolization.

1141,24112871,"In orthopaedic surgery, accumulation of agents such as anti-infectives in the bone as target tissue is difficult. The use of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) as carriers principally enables their accumulation via an externally applied magnetic field. Magnetizable implants are principally able to increase the strength of an externally applied magnetic field to reach also deep-seated parts in the body. Therefore, the integration of bone-addressed therapeutics in MNPs and their accumulation at a magnetic orthopaedic implant could improve the treatment of implant related infections. In this study a martensitic steel platelet as implant placeholder was used to examine its accumulation and retention capacity of MNPs in an in vitro experimental set up considering different experimental frame conditions as magnet quantity and distance to each other, implant thickness and flow velocity.
The magnetic field strength increased to approximately 112% when a martensitic stainless steel platelet was located between the magnet poles. Therewith a significantly higher amount of magnetic nanoparticles could be accumulated in the area of the platelet compared to the sole magnetic field. During flushing of the tube system mimicking the in vivo blood flow, the magnetized platelet was able to retain a higher amount of MNPs without an external magnetic field compared to the set up with no mounted platelet during flushing of the system. Generally, a higher flow velocity led to lower amounts of accumulated MNPs. A higher quantity of magnets and a lower distance between magnets led to a higher magnetic field strength. Albeit not significantly the magnetic field strength tended to increase with thicker platelets.",Do increased accumulation of magnetic nanoparticles by magnetizable implant materials for the treatment of implant-associated complications?,Yes. A martensitic steel platelet significantly improved the attachment of magnetic nanoparticles in an in vitro flow system and therewith indicates the potential of magnetic implant materials in orthopaedic surgery. The use of a remanent magnetic implant material could improve the efficiency of capturing MNPs especially when the external magnetic field is turned off thus facilitating and prolonging the effect. In this way higher drug levels in the target area might be attained resulting in lower inconveniences for the patient.,PASS,pubmedQA, I don't have information about the accumulation of magnetic nanoparticles in relation to magnetizable implant materials and their impact on implant-associated complications.,"passage 3: Remove the ice and using a plastic scraper, scrape the hardened  plastic off the coils.

The impact of Notch1 silencing by specific shRNAs on the EMT and invasion of human breast cancer MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells as well as xenografts was tested by western blot, real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunofluorescence, transwell, and immunohistochemistry assays. The effect of Slug silencing or upregulation on the EMT and invasion of breast cancer cells was analyzed, and the effect of Notch1 signaling on Slug expression was determined by the luciferase reporter assay.
The Notch1 intracellular domain (N1ICD) and Jagged1 were expressed in breast cancer cells. Notch1 silencing reversed the spontaneous EMT process and inhibited the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells and the growth of xenograft breast cancers. The expression of N1ICD was upregulated significantly by Jagged1-mediated Notch signaling activation. Moreover, Jagged1-mediated Notch signaling promoted the EMT process, migration, and invasion of breast cancer cells, which were abrogated by Notch silencing. Furthermore, the N1ICD positively regulated the Slug expression by inducing Slug promoter activation. Importantly, the knockdown of Slug weakened the invasion ability of breast cancer cells and reversed the Jagged1-induced EMT process with significantly decreased expression of vimentin and increased expression of E-cadherin.

One, the sensory conflict theory, states that sensory information provided by one sensory channel does not match the expected input from another channel; commonly, these two inputs originate in the vestibular system and the eyes. The second theory - the postural instability theory - states that motion sickness comes about not through sensory conflict, but through an inability to control one's posture.
Given that people with a motor-complete spinal cord injury cannot control their muscles below the level of the spinal lesion, we predicted that susceptibility to motion sickness would be higher in individuals who have suffered a spinal cord injury.
Twenty-one people living with chronic spinal cord injury (9 quadriplegics, 12 paraplegics) completed the Motion Sickness Susceptibility Questionnaire (MSSQ), via an online survey, to compare susceptibility to motion sickness before and after injury.
Spinal cord injury, regardless of level, did not produce an increase in susceptibility to motion sickness.",Is susceptibility to motion sickness increased following spinal cord injury?,"No. We have tested the general validity of the postural-instability theory by assessing susceptibility to motion sickness in individuals with spinal cord injury.

The authors previously established that glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) stimulates proliferation and that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) promotes photoreceptor survival and differentiation. Later findings that ceramide triggers photoreceptor apoptosis suggested sphingolipids might also control photoreceptor development. The present study investigated whether sphingosine-1-phophate (S1P), which promotes survival and differentiation in several cell types, regulates photoreceptor proliferation and differentiation and whether it is a mediator in GDNF and DHA effects.
Rat retina neuronal cultures were supplemented at day 0 or 1 with S1P, GDNF, or DHA and were treated with DL-threo-dihydrosphingosine to inhibit S1P synthesis or with brefeldin A (BFA) to block intracellular trafficking. Proliferation was quantified to determine bromodeoxyuridine uptake and number of mitotic figures. Opsin, peripherin, and sphingosine kinase (SphK), the enzyme required for S1P synthesis, were quantified by immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis.
S1P increased the proliferation of photoreceptor progenitors.

1159,25161822,"Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) is a chromatin-associated enzyme that participates in processes such as transcription and DNA repair through the regulation of chromatin structure. Accumulating evidence suggests an important role for PARP1 enzymatic activity in promoting CNS inflammation by facilitating the expression of inflammatory cytokines in glial cells. However, the molecular mechanisms by which PARP1 enzymatic activity mediates this process are not well understood. In this report we sought to determine the molecular mechanisms by which PARP1 enzymatic activity facilitates the expression of Il1Î² and TNF in LPS-stimulated BV2 cells.
PARP1 enzymatic activity and histone ADP-ribosylation were measured in LPS-stimulated BV2 cells by radioactive labelling with (32)P-NAD(+). To assess the effect of histone ADP-ribosylation on nucleosome structure, in vitro nucleosome remodeling, nuclease accessibility and binding assays were performed. These studies were complemented by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays in resting and LPS-stimulated BV2 cells in order to determine the occupancy of PARP1, nucleosomes and the RelA subunit of NF-ÎºB, as well as ADP-ribosylation, at the Il1Î² and Tnf promoters. Finally, we determined the effect of pharmacological inhibition of PARP1 enzymatic activity on the LPS stimulation-dependent induction of Il1Î² and Tnf mRNA.
Our results indicate that LPS stimulation induces PARP1 enzymatic activity and histone ADP-ribosylation in the chromatin compartment of BV2 cells. In vitro studies show that nucleosome-bound PARP1 disrupts nucleosome structure histone ADP-ribosylation, increasing the accessibility of nucleosomal DNA. Consistent with this PARP1 is constitutively associated with at the Il1Î² and Tnf promoters in resting BV2 cells. Upon stimulation with LPS, ADP-ribosylation is observed at these promoters, and this is correlated with increased recruitment of the transcription factor NF-ÎºB, resulting in robust transcription of these inflammatory cytokines.

Drug-drug interaction of statins and clopidogrel has been controversially discussed in ex vivo studies and clinical trials. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of peri-procedural statin medication on the metabolization of aspirin and clopidogrel with regard to platelet aggregation and clinical outcome in patients undergoing coronary intervention.
Patients with coronary stenting for symptomatic coronary artery disease are routinely evaluated by platelet function analysis in a monocentre registry, and for the present study, a consecutive cohort of 1155 patients were analysed. About 87.7% of the patients were treated with statins at the time of platelet function analysis. Residual platelet activity assessed by adenosine diphosphate (20 micromol/L)-induced platelet aggregation was not significantly influenced by statin treatment. Nor the significant effects of CYP3A4-metabolization pathway on post-treatment aggregation were recorded, although there was even a trend to lower RPA values in patients treated with CYP3A4-metabolized statins. Further, in an inter-individual analysis comparing patients treated with CYP3A4- and non-CYP3A4-metabolized statins, no time-dependent difference of clopidogreÄºs anti-aggregatory effects was observed. Clinical follow-up of major adverse events (myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, death) in 991 patients within 3 months revealed no significant adverse effects of statin treatment on clinical outcome. Instead, statin treatment was independently associated with lower incidence of composite events (HR 0.44, 95% confidence interval 0.23-0.83, P = 0.01).",Do statins adversely affect post-interventional residual platelet aggregation and outcomes in patients undergoing coronary stenting treated by dual antiplatelet therapy?,No. Peri-procedural co-administration of statins does not increase the post-interventional RPA in cardiovascular patients treated with dual antiplatelet therapy and does not worsen the clinical prognosis of these patients.,PASS,pubmedQA, I don't have the specific information to answer that question as it is not related to the provided context about species-specific clinical characteristics of human coronavirus infection among otherwise healthy adolescents and adults.,"Speciesâ€specific clinical characteristics of human coronavirus infection among otherwise healthy adolescents and adults

However, reports in children have been inconsistent. We sought to determine whether response to IVIG is predictive of response to splenectomy in children.
Thirty-two assessable children were identified by a retrospective chart review. Response was graded according to previously published criteria as follows: ""excellent"" (platelets >150 000 within 1 week), ""good"" (platelets between 50 000 and 150 000), and ""poor"" (platelets <50 000).

Twenty-one of 23 patients who had a good or excellent response to IVIG also had an excellent response to splenectomy. Six of 9 patients who had a poor response to IVIG also had a poor response to splenectomy. Response to IVIG was a sensitive predictor of response to splenectomy in 88% of patients.

We investigated A-A8's effect on cell migration, proliferation, and colony formation in 2 pancreatic cancer cells (BXPC-3 and Panc-1). Statistical analyses included Fisher exact test, t test, analysis of variance, and survival analysis.
Western blot showed increased A-A8 expression in human pancreatic cancer cells, with A-A8 knockdown in BXPC-3 and Panc-1 cells demonstrating decreased cell viability (P = 0.017 and P = 0.001), migration (2.5 vs 0.9 mm and 1.6 vs 1 mm at 96 hours; P = 0.048 and P = 0.004), and colony formation (approximately 75% and 40% from scramble; P â‰¤ 0.01), respectively.

Hypercholesterolemic (0.5% wt/wt diet) or normal rabbits received either repeated intravenous injections of AOPPs modified rabbit serum albumin (AOPPs-RSA) or unmodified RSA for 8 weeks. Compared with RSA- or vehicle-treated hypercholesterolemic rabbits, AOPPs-RSA-treated animals displayed increased atherosclerotic plaque area oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) deposition, macrophage infiltration, and smooth muscle cell proliferation. Aortic sections from AOPPs-RSA-treated normal rabbits showed significant focal intima proliferation and mild Oil-Red-O staining lipid deposition in the affected areas, a phenomenon not observed in the RSA- or vehicle-treated controls. Plasma AOPPs levels in AOPPs-treated groups significantly increased in both hypercholesterolemic and normal rabbits compared with their relevant controls. Close correlations were found between plasma levels of AOPPs and the parameters of oxidative stress, eg, oxLDL and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances levels, or glutathione peroxidase activity. A highly significant correlation was also observed between plasma AOPPs and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha levels.",Do advanced oxidation protein products accelerate atherosclerosis through promoting oxidative stress and inflammation?,Yes.

1166,25069832,"In breast cancer, distinct expression profiles of microRNAs (miRNAs) have been associated with molecular subgroups and clinicopathological characteristics, implicating a diagnostic and prognostic role of miRNAs. However, the biological functions of deregulated miRNAs in tumor progression are not yet completely defined. In this study, we investigated the function of miR-18a in regulating breast cancer metastasis through the hypoxia-inducible factor 1Î± (HIF1A)-dependent hypoxic response.
An orthotopic metastatic breast cancer xenograft model (MDA-MB-231 cells) was used to identify miRNAs associated with spontaneous lung metastasis. The function of miR-18a in regulating HIF1A expression, as well as cellular responses to hypoxia and metastasis, were then studied in vitro and in vivo by assessing ectopic miR-18a expression or miR-18a inhibition. miRNA-mRNA interactions (AGO2 immunoprecipitation and 3' untranslated region Luciferase reporter assays), gene expression (quantitative PCR and microarray), cell migration and invasion, and cell growth were assessed under normoxic or hypoxic conditions, complemented by orthotopic xenograft of tumor cells to the mammary fat pad to investigate the effect of modulating miR-18a expression on primary tumor growth and lung metastasis. Last, clinically relevant correlations between miR-18a, HIF1A, hypoxia-responsive gene expression and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) were assessed using published expression array breast tumors data sets.
miRNAs encoded by the MIR17HG gene were downregulated in lung metastases compared to primary tumors. Ectopic expression of miR-18a, a MIR17HG family member, in a metastatic variant of MDA-MB-231 cells reduced primary tumor growth and lung metastasis, whereas miR-18a inhibition in the parental cells promoted tumor growth and lung metastasis. We identified HIF1A as a direct target of miR-18a. Modulating miR-18a expression significantly affected hypoxic gene expression, cell invasiveness and sensitivity to anoikis and hypoxia in vitro in a HIF1A-dependent manner. Analysis of previously published data revealed that higher expression of HIF1A and a panel of hypoxic genes is associated with shorter DMFS interval in patients with basal-like breast tumors, and that, within this subtype, miR-18a expression is inversely correlated with hypoxic gene expression.

We investigated four hypotheses regarding factors that affect blood-feeding rates, proportion of human-fed bugs (human blood index), and daily human-feeding rates of Triatoma infestans, the main vector of Chagas disease.
A cross-sectional survey collected triatomines in human sleeping quarters (domiciles) of 49 of 270 rural houses in northwestern Argentina. We developed an improved way of estimating the human-feeding rate of domestic T. infestans populations. We fitted generalized linear mixed-effects models to a global model with six explanatory variables (chicken blood index, dog blood index, bug stage, numbers of human residents, bug abundance, and maximum temperature during the night preceding bug catch) and three response variables (daily blood-feeding rate, human blood index, and daily human-feeding rate). Coefficients were estimated via multimodel inference with model averaging.
Median blood-feeding intervals per late-stage bug were 4.1 days, with large variations among households. The main bloodmeal sources were humans (68%), chickens (22%), and dogs (9%). Blood-feeding rates decreased with increases in the chicken blood index. Both the human blood index and daily human-feeding rate decreased substantially with increasing proportions of chicken- or dog-fed bugs, or the presence of chickens indoors.

In ulcerative colitis (UC) butyrate oxidation has been shown to be disturbed, but it remains unclear whether this is a primary defect. The aim of this study was to measure mucosal butyrate oxidation in UC (involved and noninvolved colon) and in pouchitis and to study the relationship with endoscopic as well as histological disease activity.
Butyrate oxidation was measured in 73 UC patients, 22 pouchitis patients, and 112 controls (95 colon, 17 ileum) by incubating biopsies with 1 mM 14C-labeled Na-butyrate and measuring the released 14CO2.
Compared with that in normal colon, butyrate oxidation was significantly impaired in endoscopically active but not in quiescent disease or uninvolved colon segments. The severity of the metabolic defect was related to histological disease activity and decreased epithelial cell height. In active pouchitis, butyrate oxidation was significantly decreased compared with that in normal ileum and excluded pouches without inflammation. The histological pouchitis score correlated significantly with butyrate oxidation.","Is pouchitis , similar to active ulcerative colitis , associated with impaired butyrate oxidation by intestinal mucosa?",Yes.

1175,17244356,"According to the traditional two-stage model of face processing, the face-specific N170 event-related potential (ERP) is linked to structural encoding of face stimuli, whereas later ERP components are thought to reflect processing of facial affect. This view has recently been challenged by reports of N170 modulations by emotional facial expression. This study examines the time-course and topography of the influence of emotional expression on the N170 response to faces.
Dense-array ERPs were recorded in response to a set (n = 16) of fear and neutral faces. Stimuli were normalized on dimensions of shape, size and luminance contrast distribution. To minimize task effects related to facial or emotional processing, facial stimuli were irrelevant to a primary task of learning associative pairings between a subsequently presented visual character and a spoken word.
N170 to faces showed a strong modulation by emotional facial expression. A split half analysis demonstrates that this effect was significant both early and late in the experiment and was therefore not associated with only the initial exposures of these stimuli, demonstrating a form of robustness against habituation. The effect of emotional modulation of the N170 to faces did not show significant interaction with the gender of the face stimulus, or hemisphere of recording sites. Subtracting the fear versus neutral topography provided a topography that itself was highly similar to the face N170.",Is the face-specific N170 component modulated by emotional facial expression?,"Yes. The face N170 response can be influenced by emotional expressions contained within facial stimuli. The topography of this effect is consistent with the notion that fear stimuli exaggerates the N170 response itself. This finding stands in contrast to previous models suggesting that N170 processes linked to structural analysis of faces precede analysis of emotional expression, and instead may reflect early top-down modulation from neural systems involved in rapid emotional processing.",PASS,pubmedQA, I don't have information about the face-specific N170 component and its relationship with emotional facial expressions in my context.,"According to Equation (23) we can easily see the following.

1176,12407146,"To examine the mechanism underlying transcript heterogeneity in the gene for the retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator (RPGR).
Transcript heterogeneity was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR), rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), and transient expression of minigene constructs. Protein variants were identified by immunoblot analysis and by immunocytochemistry.
RPGR transcripts terminated either uniformly at the end of exon 19, producing the constitutive transcript with few variants, or at variable sites downstream from exon 15. The latter transcripts resembled the previously described open reading frame (ORF)14/15 variant, but the ORF14/15 exon was not found in full length. Instead, various portions of a purine-rich region were removed as introns. Numerous splice site combinations were used, giving rise to innumerable variants. Analysis of the purine-rich region found multiple exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) known to promote splicing through interaction with serine-arginine repeat (SR) proteins. Antibodies targeting different regions of RPGR detected a multitude of RPGR proteins in photoreceptors, concentrated in the connecting cilium. Predominant ORF14/15-encoded RPGR polypeptides migrated at approximately 200 kDa and were photoreceptor specific.",Does complex expression pattern of RPGR reveal a role for purine-rich exonic splicing enhancers?,Yes. The exceptional heterogeneity in RPGR transcript processing results primarily from a novel form of alternative RNA splicing mediated by multiple exonic splicing enhancers.

Prior to in vitro fertilization (IVF) or ICSI, the oocytes were subjected to in vitro maturation (IVM) for 24Â h. First, to evaluate the need of artificial activation for ovine ICSI, 226 oocytes were injected with intact spermatozoa (IS), from which 125 were activated by incubation in ionomycin and 101 were cultured without activation. Next, spermatozoa were mechanically (by piezo-electrical pulses) and/or chemically (by ionomycin/Triton X-100) treated to break membranes and acrosomes and were injected into oocytes, grouped as follows: (i) piezo-pulsed spermatozoa (PPS), (ii) PPS pre-treated with ionomycin (PPS-I), (iii) PPS pre-treated with Triton X-100 (PPS-T), and (iv) intact and untreated spermatozoa as a control (CTR-IS).

1184,23339127,"Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) are antigen-presenting cells specialized in antiviral response. The measles virus vaccine is proposed as an antitumor agent to target and specifically kill tumor cells without infecting healthy cells.
Here, we investigated, in vitro, the effects of measles virus vaccine-infected tumor cells on the phenotype and functions of human pDC. We studied maturation and tumor antigen cross-presentation by pDC, exposed either to the virus alone, or to measles virus vaccine-infected or UV-irradiated tumor cells.
We found that only measles virus vaccine-infected cells induced pDC maturation with a strong production of IFN-Î±, whereas UV-irradiated tumor cells were unable to activate pDC. This IFN-Î± production was triggered by the interaction of measles virus vaccine single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) with TLR7. We observed that measles virus vaccine-infected tumor cells were phagocytosed by pDC. Interestingly, we showed cross-presentation of the tumor antigen NYESO-1 to a specific CD8(+) T-cell clone when pDC were cocultured with measles virus vaccine-infected tumor cells, whereas pDC were unable to cross-present NYESO-1 after coculture with UV-irradiated tumor cells.",Do measles virus vaccine-infected tumor cells induce tumor antigen cross-presentation by human plasmacytoid dendritic cells?,"Yes.

It is now clear that codon identity alterations involve sense and non-sense codons and can occur in organisms with complex genomes and proteomes. However, the biological functions, the molecular mechanisms of evolution and the diversity of genetic code alterations remain largely unknown.

We are using this codon identity redefinition as a model system to elucidate the evolution of genetic code alterations.
We have reconstructed the early stages of the Candida genetic code alteration by engineering tRNAs that partially reverted the identity of serine CUG codons back to their standard leucine meaning.

The protein, phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome Ten (PTEN) is a major suppressor of phosphoinositide-3 kinase/Akt signalling, a vital survival pathway in lung parenchymal cells. Based on this, we hypothesized that PTEN inhibition in vivo would enhance cell tolerance to stress thereby preventing acute lung injury.
We evaluated the ability of a PTEN inhibitor, potassium bisperoxo (1,10-phenanthroline) oxovanadate [bpV(phen)], to prevent acute lung injury induced by oleic acid (OA) in adult C57BL/6 mice. Lung assessments included bronchoalveolar lavage, tissue morphology, immunostaining for markers of cell death, cell identity, phospho-Akt and phospho-ERK levels and oximetry.
OA induced acute lung injury in a dose- and time-dependent manner. No injury was observed in the vehicle control or bpV(phen) treatment groups. PTEN inhibition by bpV(phen) increased lung tissue levels of phospho-Akt and ERK and but not focal adhesion kinase. This occurred in conjunction with a statistically significant reduction in protein content, lactate dehydrogenase, as well as tumour necrosis factor-alpha and chemokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid when compared with OA treatment alone.

To measure the site-specific changes in elastin content that accompany disc degeneration using a quantitative, dye-binding assay to assess elastin levels.
Recently, an abundant and organized network of elastic fibers was observed in nondegenerated human disc using immunostaining histochemistry, suggesting a functional role for elastin. While degenerative changes in the disc extracellular matrix composition are well known, changes in elastin content that may accompany degeneration have not been reported.
Human discs were assigned a degenerative grade by 3 independent orthopedic surgeons based on gross morphology. Samples were taken from the outer anulus fibrosus (OAF), inner AF (IAF) and nucleus pulposus (NP). Elastin content was measured using a specific, dye-binding assay and normalized to dry weight and collagen content, which was measured via a hydroxyproline assay. Samples were divided into 2 groups: nondegenerate (Grades 1-2.5) and degenerate (Grades 2.6-4.0). A 2-way analysis of variance was used to test for statistical significance where the 2 factors were disc location and degeneration. Correlations of composition with degeneration and age were analyzed.
In nondegenerate tissue, elastin by dry weight was on average 2.0% +/- 0.3%, and there were no differences in elastin content among the locations of OAF, IAF, or NP.

1215,26103960,"Environmental enteropathy is subclinical inflammation of the upper gastrointestinal tract associated with reduced linear growth in developing countries. Usually investigators have used biopsy or a dual sugar absorption test to assess environmental enteropathy. Such tests are time and resource intensive, restricting their utility as screening methods. Serum endotoxin core antibody (EndoCab) concentration is a potential indicator of intestinal inflammation and integrity, and thus may be useful to predict environmental enteropathy. We analyzed the association of serum EndoCab levels versus linear growth and lactulose-mannitol assay results in 2-5 year old rural Malawian children.
This was an observational study of 388 rural, asymptomatic Malawian children who had anthropometric measurements taken at least every 3 months since birth. In June and July 2011, dual sugar permeability tests were performed and serum samples were drawn for EndoCab assays. Pearson correlation, Student's t test and multivariable linear regression were used to compare ln EndoCab concentrations with height-for-age z scores (HAZ) at time of sampling and 3 months later. Identical analysis was also performed for ln EndoCab versus measurements from dual sugar permeability testing performed in conjunction with serum sampling. In a subgroup of children with anthropometric data in the months prior to serum sampling, Pearson correlation was used to estimate the relationship between ln EndoCab and recent linear growth.
Ln EndoCab concentrations were not correlated with HAZ at time of measurement (B = -0.078, P = 0.14) nor change in HAZ over the subsequent 3 months HAZ (B = -0.018, P = 0.27). EndoCab concentration was not associated with %lactulose excretion (B < 0.001, P = 0.98) nor the lactulose:mannitol ratio (B = 0.021, P = 0.62).

To determine whether airway inflammation and lung bacterial colonization are related to nutritional status or predict progressive weight loss and muscle atrophy in patients with COPD.
Body composition using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, indices of airway inflammation, and bacterial colonization were measured in 234 COPD patients. Systemic inflammation was assessed from serum C reactive protein (CRP) and circulating total and differential leukocyte counts. Nutritional depletion was defined as a body mass index (BMI) less than 21 kg/m(2) and/or fat-free mass index (FFMI) less than 15 or 17 kg/m(2) in women and men, respectively. FFMI was calculated as the fat-free mass (FFM) corrected for body surface area. Measurements were repeated in 94 patients after a median 16-month follow-up. Regression analysis was used to assess the relationships of weight change and FFM change with indices of bacterial colonization and airway and systemic inflammation.
Nutritional depletion occurred in 37% of patients. Lung function was worsened in patients with nutritional depletion compared to those without (forced expiratory volume in 1 second 1.17 L versus 1.41 L, mean difference 0.24, 95% confidence interval 0.10 to 0.38, P<0.01). There were no differences in airway inflammation and bacterial colonization in patients with and without nutritional depletion.

Macrophage subtypes in situ in intestinal specimens of patients with IBD were visualized by immunohistochemistry. In vitro polarization of human peripheral CD14 cells yielded M1 or M2 macrophages. The influence of primary monocytes or macrophage subtypes on epithelial barrier integrity was analyzed by transepithelial resistance measurements, Western blot analysis, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and cytometric bead array in a coculture model of primary human macrophages and layers of intestinal epithelial cell lines.
The lamina propria of the inflamed intestine in patients with IBD, predominantly in Crohn's disease, is massively infiltrated by CD68 cells also positive for inducible nitric oxide synthase and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) Î±. The presence of M1 macrophage shifted the balance in the local macrophage compartment towards a proinflammatory state. In the coculture model, monocytes and M1 macrophages reduced transepithelial resistance as a marker for epithelial barrier integrity. The mechanisms for paracellular leakage included intracellular relocalization of tight junction proteins like claudin-2 and epithelial cell apoptosis.

Here, we investigated the mechanism of CFTR inhibition by loop diuretics and explored the effects of chemical structure on channel blockade.
Using the patch-clamp technique, we tested the effects of bumetanide, furosemide, piretanide and xipamide on recombinant wild-type human CFTR.
When added to the intracellular solution, loop diuretics inhibited CFTR Cl(-) currents with potency approaching that of glibenclamide, a widely used CFTR blocker with some structural similarity to loop diuretics. To begin to study the kinetics of channel blockade, we examined the time dependence of macroscopic current inhibition following a hyperpolarizing voltage step. Like glibenclamide, piretanide blockade of CFTR was time and voltage dependent. By contrast, furosemide blockade was voltage dependent, but time independent. Consistent with these data, furosemide blocked individual CFTR Cl(-) channels with 'very fast' speed and drug-induced blocking events overlapped brief channel closures, whereas piretanide inhibited individual channels with 'intermediate' speed and drug-induced blocking events were distinct from channel closures.",Are loop diuretics open-channel blockers of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator with distinct kinetics?,"Yes. Structure-activity analysis of the loop diuretics suggests that the phenoxy group present in bumetanide and piretanide, but absent in furosemide and xipamide, might account for the different kinetics of channel block by locking loop diuretics within the intracellular vestibule of the CFTR pore. We conclude that loop diuretics are open-channel blockers of CFTR with distinct kinetics, affected by molecular dimensions and lipophilicity.",PASS,pubmedQA," No, loop diuretics are not open-channel blockers of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator with distinct kinetics.","been identified by screening bacteriophage-displays or microarray peptide libraries with polyclonal antibodies targeting the native antigen to select conformational epitopes that can be fused to fluorescent proteins for use in flow cytometry (47, 60) .

The finding that a single miRNA can regulate hundreds of genes places miRNAs at critical hubs of signaling pathways. For the current study, the authors investigated the miRNA expression profile of gastric adenocarcinomas and compared it with esophageal adenocarcinomas to better identify a unique miRNA signature of gastric adenocarcinoma.
miRNA expression profiles were obtained using 2 different proprietary microarray platforms on primary gastric adenocarcinoma tissue samples. The cross comparison of results identified 17 up-regulated miRNAs and 12 down-regulated miRNAs that overlapped in both platforms. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed for independent validation of a representative set of 8 miRNAs in gastric and esophageal adenocarcinomas compared with normal gastric mucosa or esophageal mucosa, respectively.
The deregulation of miR-146b-5p, miR-375, miR-148a, miR-31, and miR-451 was associated significantly with gastric adenocarcinomas. Conversely, deregulation of miR-21 (up-regulation) and miR-133b (down-regulation) was detectable in both gastric and esophageal adenocarcinomas. It was noteworthy that miR-200a was significantly down-regulated in gastric adenocarcinoma samples (P = .04) but was up-regulated in esophageal adenocarcinoma samples (P = .001).

We hypothesized that secretoneurin might act as an angiogenic cytokine and tested for these effects in vivo using a mouse cornea neovascularization model and in vitro by assessing capillary tube formation in a matrigel assay. In vivo, secretoneurin-induced neovasculature is characterized by a distinct pattern of arterial and venous vessels of large diameter and length. Immunohistochemical staining for CD-31 revealed endothelial lining of the inner surface of these vessels, and recruitment of alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive perivascular cells suggests vessel maturation. In vitro, secretoneurin-induced capillary tube formation was dose dependent and specific, confirming that effects of secretoneurin occur directly on endothelial cells.

The aim of this study was to analyze the associations between diet, body composition, lipids and atheroprotective natural antibodies against phosphorylcholine (anti-PC) in patients with RA.
A total of 80 RA patients (76% women), mean age (standard deviation (SD)) 61.4 (12) years and median disease duration of 6 years, were assessed by food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), fatty acid profile in adipose tissue and whole-body dual energy x ray absorptiometry (DXA). Rheumatoid cachexia was defined as fat free mass index below the 25th percentile and fat mass index above the 50th percentile of a reference population. Blood lipids, oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) and anti-PC levels were determined.
The mean body mass index for the women and men was 25.0 and 27.0, respectively. Central obesity was found in 57% of the women (waist circumference >80 cm) and in 89% of the men (waist circumference >94 cm). In all, 18% of the women and 26% of the men had rheumatoid cachexia. These patients had significantly higher total cholesterol (P < 0.033), LDL (P < 0.029), and trendwise oxLDL (P = 0.056) as well as lower anti-PC IgM (P = 0.040), higher frequency of hypertension (69%) and metabolic syndrome (25%) than those without. The patients reported a high dietary intake of saturated fat, which partly correlated with fatty acid composition in adipose tissue and significantly with disease activity. However, patients with or without cachexia did not differ with respect to dietary fat intake or intake of Mediterranean-like diet. Additionally, patients on a Mediterranean-like diet had high levels of anti-PC (P < 0.001).",Is rheumatoid cachexia associated with dyslipidemia and low levels of atheroprotective natural antibodies against phosphorylcholine but not with dietary fat in patients with rheumatoid arthritis : a cross-sectional study?,"Yes.

Hepatic stellate cells activate during chronic liver injury and mediate the fibrotic response. These cells are also major repositories for lipids, but the role of lipid metabolism during stellate cell activation remains unclear. We investigated the role of LXR signaling stellate cell activation and susceptibility to fibrotic liver disease.
Immortalized and primary stellate cells purified from mice were treated with highly specific LXR ligands. Carbon tetrachloride and methionine/choline deficiency were used as chronic liver injury models. Reciprocal bone marrow transplants were performed to test the importance of hematopoietically derived cells to the fibrotic response.
LXR ligands suppressed markers of fibrosis and stellate cell activation in primary mouse stellate cells.

Whether species-specific variation in TAS2R pseudogenes is solely the result of genetic drift or whether it may have been influenced by selection due to different feeding behaviors has been an open question.
In this study, we analyzed patterns of variation at human TAS2R pseudogenes in both African and non-African populations, and compared them to those observable in nonhuman primates and archaic human species. Our results showed a similar worldwide distribution of allelic variation for most of the pseudogenes, with the exception of the TAS2R6P and TAS2R18P loci, both of which presented an unexpected higher frequency of derived alleles outside Africa. At the TAS2R6P locus, two SNPs were found in strong linkage disequilibrium (r2â€‰>â€‰0.9) with variants in the functional TAS2R5 gene, which showed signatures of selection. The human TAS2R18P carried a species-specific stop-codon upstream of four polymorphic insertions in the reading frame. SNPs at this locus showed significant positive values in a number of neutrality statistics, and age estimates indicated that they arose after the homo-chimp divergence.",Does genetic variation in taste receptor pseudogenes provide evidence for a dynamic role in human evolution?,"Yes. The similar distribution of variation of many human bitter receptor pseudogenes among human populations suggests that they arose from the ancestral forms by a unidirectional loss of function. However we explain the higher frequency of TAS2R6P derived alleles outside Africa as the effect of the balancing selection acting on the closely linked TAS2R5 gene. In contrast, TAS2R18P displayed a more complex history, suggesting an acquired function followed by a recent pseudogenization that predated the divergence of human modern and archaic species, which we hypothesize was associated with adaptions to dietary changes.",PASS,pubmedQA," Yes, the incorporation of mutations during specific seasons (as seen from December-March 2006) suggests a dynamic role in human evolution.","found there had incorporated the mutation (December-March 2006), indicating a genotype switch during the winter season [5, 18, 20] .

1270,9551677,"Whether mutations in the putative haemochromatosis gene (HFE) and hepatitis C virus act independently to precipitate porphyria cutanea tarda is unknown. The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between mutations in HFE, hepatitis C and porphyria cutanea tarda.
The frequencies of the C282Y and H63D mutations in HFE were determined in 27 patients with porphyria cutanea tarda and compared with the reported control frequencies. In addition, the presence of hepatitis C virus infection was identified and related to the patients' HFE status.
The C282Y mutation was found in 44.4% of patients compared with the control frequency of 12% (p<0.001). Three patients were homozygous for the C282Y mutation, two of whom did not meet current clinical diagnostic criteria for expressed haemochromatosis. The proportion of patients with the H63D mutation did not differ from the reported control frequency. The mean transferrin saturation and serum ferritin concentration were similar in porphyria cutanea tarda patients who were homozygous normal and heterozygous for the C282Y mutation, but greater in both groups than previously reported in healthy controls. Seven (25.9%) patients were anti-HCV IgG positive. None of these patients carried the C282Y mutation. Porphyria cutanea tarda patients heterozygous for the C282Y mutation and patients with anti-HCV antibodies had elevated transferrin saturations and serum ferritin concentrations.",Are the C282Y mutation in the haemochromatosis gene ( HFE ) and hepatitis C virus infection independent cofactors for porphyria cutanea tarda in Australian patients?,"Yes. The raised frequency of the C282Y mutation in porphyria cutanea tarda indicates that this mutation is likely to be a predisposing factor. However, abnormalities of iron indices also exist in porphyria cutanea tarda patients without mutations in HFE.

1271,23574883,"Some recent experimental data suggest a possible role of LINGO-1 in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS). In an attempt to identify genetic biomarkers related to MS susceptibility, we genotyped two common SNPs in the LINGO1 gene which have been associated to other neurological conditions, in patients with MS and in healthy subjects. These SNPs are linked to several SNPs within the LINGO1 gene, especially in individuals of Oriental or Caucasian descent.
We analyzed the allelic and genotype frequency of two LINGO1 variants (rs9652490 and rs11856808) in 293 patients with MS and 318 healthy controls, using KASPar assays.
LINGO1 rs9652490 and rs11856808 allelic and genotype frequencies did not differ significantly between MS patients and controls. The minor allele frequencies for rs9652490 were 0.171 (95% CI = 0.140-0.201) and 0.167 (95% CI = 0.138-0.196 for cases and controls respectively (p = 0.853).

Cognitive outcomes in ICH patients receiving seizure prophylaxis with levetiracetam or phenytoin are compared.
A retrospective chart review was conducted with 269 patients who received prophylactic levetiracetam or phenytoin between August 2005 and May 2008. A total of 85 reviewed patients met inclusion criteria (phenytoin n = 25, levetiracetam n = 60).

1273,16481245,"Rats with nitrofen-induced congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) have hypoplasia and malformations of the heart. The mechanism of action of nitrofen involves changes in neural crest signaling. Pax3 function is required for cardiac neural crest cells to complete their migration to the developing heart. Vitamin A improves heart hypoplasia. The aims of this study were to examine whether Pax3 expression is decreased in the heart of E13 E15 and E21 rats exposed to nitrofen and if vitamin A reverts this effect.
Pregnant rats received either 100 mg nitrofen or olive oil on E9.5. Each group was divided into 2 subgroups according to the subsequent treatment with intragastric vitamin A (15000 IU) or vehicle on E10.5 to E11.5. The pups were recovered on E13, E15 and E21 and the hearts were dissected out. Pax3 mRNA expression was determined by quantitative real time PCR. Comparisons among groups were made with ANOVA and Bonferroni post hoc tests with a threshold of significance of P < .05.
Pax3 mRNA expression was significantly decreased on E13 and E15 in the hearts of nitrofen-treated embryos and it remained decreased although not significantly on E21. Vitamin A recovered this expression on E13, partially on E15 and above normal levels on E21.",Does vitamin A improve Pax3 expression that is decreased in the heart of rats with experimental diaphragmatic hernia?,Yes. Pax3 is underexpressed in the hearts of nitrofen exposed embryonal rats on days 13th and 15th of gestation and tends to be lower than normal near term. Vitamin A up-regulates this expression on the 3 end points. The mechanism of action of Pax3 should be further investigated because it could be one of the targets for future prenatal transplacental intervention.,PASS,pubmedQA, I don't have information to confirm whether vitamin A improves Pax3 expression that is decreased in the heart of rats with experimental diaphragmatic hernia.,"Although the cardioprotective effects of supplemental doses of vitamin E have been investigated in several conditions, its role in gonadectomy- induced fatty lesion formation is unclear. The present study was designed to examine the efficacy of vitamin E in a dose-dependent manner on indices of oxidative stress and in preventing the formation of aortic fatty lesions in orchidectomized (Orx) aged rats.

We evaluated the ability of a PTEN inhibitor, potassium bisperoxo (1,10-phenanthroline) oxovanadate [bpV(phen)], to prevent acute lung injury induced by oleic acid (OA) in adult C57BL/6 mice. Lung assessments included bronchoalveolar lavage, tissue morphology, immunostaining for markers of cell death, cell identity, phospho-Akt and phospho-ERK levels and oximetry.

Nor-NOHA treatment fully restored the aortic response to Ach to that of healthy controls. The results showed that this beneficial effect is mediated by an increase in NOS activity and EDHF and reduced superoxide anion production as well as a decrease in the activity of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, thromboxane and prostacyclins synthases. In addition, nor-NOHA decreased IL-6 and VEGF plasma levels in AIA rats. By contrast, the treatment did not modify arthritis severity in AIA rats."

Epidemiological studies support the role of antioxidants in the etiology of cataract, but the evidence for one specific antioxidant over another is inconsistent. Few studies have examined the association of cataract with fruit and vegetable intake with inconclusive results. In the present study, the relationship between cataract and fruit and vegetable intake and dietary and blood levels of carotenoids, vitamins C and E were examined in a Spanish Mediterranean population.
The present work is an analysis of data from 599 elderly ( â‰¥ 65 years) participants from the Spanish segment of the EUREYE study. This is a European multi-center cross-sectional population-based study. Cataract was diagnosed using a slit-lamp examination and defined as any lens opacity in either eye or evidence of its removal (cataract extraction). Energy-adjusted intake of fruit and vegetables and antioxidant vitamins was estimated using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Plasma concentrations of vitamin C were analyzed by a colorimetric method and carotenoids and Î±-tocopherol by a HPLC method. The associations between cataract and quartiles of fruit and vegetable intake and plasma antioxidants were investigated using logistic regression models.
Of the 599 elderly recruited, 433 (73%) had cataract or cataract extraction, 54% were women and 46% were men. After adjustments, increasing quartiles of combined fruit and vegetable intake were associated with decreasing reduction of odds of cataract or cataract extraction, (P for trend = 0.008). Increasing quartiles of dietary intakes from 107 mg/d of vitamin C showed a significant decreasing association with prevalence of cataract or cataract extraction (P for trend = 0.047).

Mice harboring liver-specific RB ablation and normal littermates were exposed to the hepatocarcinogen diethylnitrosamine (DEN). The influence of RB loss on liver tumorigenesis was assessed by evaluating tumor multiplicity, proliferation, and genome integrity within tumors arising in RB-deficient and wild-type livers. In silico analyses were used to probe the association between gene expression signatures for RB loss and chromosomal instability and the ability of genes up-regulated by RB loss to predict the survival of human HCC patients.
RB deficiency significantly increased tumor multiplicity in livers exposed to DEN. Although hepatocytes in nontumor regions of DEN-exposed livers were quiescent regardless of RB status, tumors arising in RB-deficient livers were significantly more proliferative than those in normal livers and expressed high levels of RB/E2F target genes. Analysis of genes up-regulated by RB loss demonstrated significant overlap with a gene expression signature associated with chromosomal instability. Correspondingly, tumors arising in RB-deficient livers were significantly more likely to harbor hepatocytes exhibiting altered ploidy. Finally, gene expression analysis of human HCCs demonstrated that elevated expression of RB-regulated genes independently predicts poor survival.",Does rB loss abrogate cell cycle control and genome integrity to promote liver tumorigenesis?,"Yes.

We sought to define the frequency at which a rare adverse event would have to occur for the risks of combination therapy to outweigh the benefits of treatment.
We constructed a decision model to compare the risks and benefits of IFX/AZA with IFX monotherapy. Model parameters were taken from SONIC and other published literature. The base-case analysis was patients with active Crohn's disease who are naÃ¯ve to both medications (similar to those in SONIC) who were treated for 1 year. We used sensitivity analyses to determine the thresholds at which the risks of side effects from IFX/AZA outweigh its benefits.

Up to 2002 a total of 150 incident acute coronary events occurred. Baseline levels of GGT were higher in men who experienced an event than in event-free men (28.4+/-2.0 units/l versus 22.4+/-2.1 units/l, p 0.0002). GGT was highly correlated with other cardiovascular risk factors. In a Cox proportional hazards model after age adjustment hazard ratios (HR) for incident myocardial infarction across GGT quartiles (<13, 13 to <20, 20 to <35, and >/=35 units/l) were 1.0, 1.84, 2.02, and 3.08 (p for trend 0.0001).

In 1999-2002, 1152 adult asthmatics were identified in the European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS)-II and the socio-economic burden (reduced activity days and hospital services utilization in the past 12 months) was assessed.
The asthmatics with a light burden (only a few reduced activity days) were 13.2% (95% CI: 11.4-15.3%), whereas those with a heavy burden (many reduced activity days and/or hospital services utilization) were 14.0% (95% CI: 12.1-16.1%). The burden was strongly associated with disease severity and a lower quality of life. Obese asthmatics had a significantly increased risk of a light [relative risk ratio (RRR) = 2.17; 95% CI: 1.18-4.00] or a heavy burden (RRR = 2.77; 95% CI: 1.52-5.05) compared with normal/underweight subjects.

1286,21039404,"Serum and IgG isolated from patients with the autoimmune blistering disease pemphigus vulgaris (PV) trigger complex intracellular pathways in keratinocytes, including alterations of the cell cycle and metabolism, which ultimately lead to cell-cell detachment (acantholysis). We have shown previously that one of the earliest pathogenic events in PV is the activation of protein kinases, including the PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum (ER) kinase PERK.
In the present study we investigated in more detail the role of PERK in the pathogenesis of PV.
PERK levels were assessed by Western blotting and in-cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and PERK expression was silenced by siRNA technology. The effects of PV sera/IgG on keratinocyte cultures were investigated by flow cytometry, MTT and adhesion assays.
We show that PERK is activated in keratinocytes exposed to PV serum, as demonstrated by an increase in phosphorylated PERK levels and phosphorylation of eIF2Î±. Decreased expression of PERK by siRNA reduced the effects of PV serum on the cell cycle and keratinocyte viability, two key events in PV pathophysiology. As impairment of metabolic activity in PV is partially due to non-IgG serum factors, we then investigated the activation of PERK in keratinocytes incubated with whole PV serum, purified PV IgG and IgG-depleted PV serum. The data demonstrated that PV sera depleted of IgG, but not PV IgG, triggered PERK phosphorylation and this correlated with a marked reduction of metabolic activity in keratinocytes exposed to IgG-free serum. Knockdown of PERK by siRNA abrogated the changes in the cell cycle and apoptosis induced by IgG-depleted PV serum. Finally, the reduction of metabolic activity observed in keratinocytes exposed to IgG-depleted PV serum was almost absent in PERK-deficient cells.",Does deregulation of PERK in the autoimmune disease pemphigus vulgaris occur via IgG-independent mechanisms?,"Yes.

Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) was used to induce sepsis in mice. Survival rates were monitored and plasma indices of organ function were measured. Ex vivo studies included the measurement of vascular function in thoracic aortic rings, assessment of oxidative stress/cellular injury in various organs and the measurement of mitochondrial function in isolated liver mitochondria.
eNOS deficiency and aging both exacerbated the mortality of sepsis. Both eNOS-deficient and aged mice exhibited a higher degree of sepsis-associated multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), infiltration of tissues with mononuclear cells and oxidative stress. A high degree of sepsis-induced vascular oxidative damage and endothelial dysfunction (evidenced by functional assays and multiple plasma markers of endothelial dysfunction) was detected in aortae isolated from both eNOS(-/-) and aged mice. There was a significant worsening of sepsis-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, both in eNOS-deficient mice and in aged mice.

1292,22059850,"Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), produced at relatively high levels by anaerobic bacteria in bacterial vaginosis (BV), are believed to be anti-inflammatory. BV, a common alteration in the genital microbiota associated with increased susceptibility to HIV infection, is characterized by increased levels of both pro-inflammatory cytokines and SCFAs. We investigated how SCFAs alone or together with Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands affected pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion.
Cytokines were measured by ELISA. Flow was used for phenotyping and reactive oxygen species (ROS) measurement.
Short-chain fatty acids, at 20 mM, induced interleukin (IL)-8, IL-6, and IL-1Î² release, while lower levels (0.02-2 mM) did not induce cytokine secretion. Levels >20 mM were toxic to cells. Interestingly, lower levels of SCFAs significantly enhanced TLR2 ligand- and TLR7 ligand-induced production of IL-8 and TNFÎ± in a time- and dose-dependent manner, but had little effect on lipopolysaccharide-induced cytokine release. SCFAs mediated their effects on pro-inflammatory cytokine production at least in part by inducing the generation of ROS.",Do short-chain fatty acids induce pro-inflammatory cytokine production alone and in combination with toll-like receptor ligands?,"Yes.

We hypothesized that the participation of noradrenalin transporters (NET) in the clearance of DA may account for the lower effect of L-DOPA in extrastriatal regions compared with the striatum.
Using a multisite intracerebral microdialysis approach, we tested the influence of the pharmacological blockade of NET and/or the destruction of noradrenalin (NE) fibers on DA and 5-HT release in the striatum, hippocampus (HIPP), substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) of 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats.

Pre-emptive liver transplantation (PLT) for PH-I is an option for children with early diagnosis. There is still little information on its effect on long-term renal function in this situation.
Long-term assessment of renal function was conducted using Schwartz's formula (estimated glomerular filtration rate-eGFR) in four children (Group A) undergoing PLT between 2002 and 2008, and a comparison was done with eight gender- and sex-matched controls (Group B) having liver transplantation for other indications.
All patients received a liver graft from a deceased donor. Median follow-up for the two groups was 64 and 94 months, respectively. One child in Group A underwent re-transplantation due to hepatic artery thrombosis, while acute rejection was seen in one.

In Drosophila melanogaster, the two group B Sox proteins Dichaete and SoxNeuro show widespread common binding across the genome. While some instances of functional compensation have been observed in Drosophila, the function of common binding and the extent of its evolutionary conservation is not known.
We used DamID-seq to examine the genome-wide binding patterns of Dichaete and SoxNeuro in four species of Drosophila. Through a quantitative comparison of Dichaete binding, we evaluated the rate of binding site turnover across the genome as well as at specific functional sites. We also examined the presence of Sox motifs within binding intervals and the correlation between sequence conservation and binding conservation. To determine whether common binding between Dichaete and SoxNeuro is conserved, we performed a detailed analysis of the binding patterns of both factors in two species.",Is common binding by redundant group B Sox proteins evolutionarily conserved in Drosophila?,"Yes. We find that, while the regulatory networks driven by Dichaete and SoxNeuro are largely conserved across the drosophilids studied, binding site turnover is widespread and correlated with phylogenetic distance. Nonetheless, binding is preferentially conserved at known cis-regulatory modules and core, independently verified binding sites. We observed the strongest binding conservation at sites that are commonly bound by Dichaete and SoxNeuro, suggesting that these sites are functionally important.

Early developmental processes that alter the number of pancreatic progenitors can determine the number of beta cells present at birth. Metformin, the most widely used oral agent for treating diabetes, alters intracellular energy status in part by increasing AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signalling. This study examined the effect of metformin on developing pancreas and beta cells.
Pancreatic rudiments from CD-1 mice at embryonic day 13.0 (E13.0) were cultured with metformin, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-Î²-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR, an AMPK activator) or vehicle control in vitro. In another set of studies, pregnant C57BL/6 mice were treated with metformin throughout gestation. Embryonic (E14.0) and neonatal pancreases were then analysed for their morphometry.
In vitro metformin treatment led to an increase in the proliferation and number of pancreatic duodenal homeobox 1-positive (PDX1(+)) progenitors. These results were reproduced by in vitro culture of embryonic pancreas rudiments with AICAR, suggesting that AMPK activation was involved.

1304,11509232,"During Drosophila embryogenesis, Jun kinase (JNK) signaling has been shown to play a key role in regulating the morphogenetic process of dorsal closure, which also serves as a model for epithelial sheet fusion during wound repair. During dorsal closure the JNK signaling cascade in the dorsal-most (leading edge) cells of the epidermis activates the AP-1 transcription factor comprised of DJUN and DFOS that, in turn, upregulates the expression of the dpp gene. DPP is a secreted morphogen that signals lateral epidermal cells to elongate along the dorsoventral axis. The leading edge cells contact the peripheral cells of a monolayer extraembryonic epithelium, the amnioserosa, which lies on the dorsal side of the embryo.

1307,20712895,"The zebrafish has been suggested as a model system for studying human diseases that affect nervous system function and motor output. However, few of the ion channels that control neuronal activity in zebrafish have been characterized. Here, we have identified zebrafish orthologs of voltage-dependent Kv3 (KCNC) K+ channels. Kv3 channels have specialized gating properties that facilitate high-frequency, repetitive firing in fast-spiking neurons. Mutations in human Kv3.3 cause spinocerebellar ataxia type 13 (SCA13), an autosomal dominant genetic disease that exists in distinct neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative forms. To assess the potential usefulness of the zebrafish as a model system for SCA13, we have characterized the functional properties of zebrafish Kv3.3 channels with and without mutations analogous to those that cause SCA13.
The zebrafish genome (release Zv8) contains six Kv3 family members including two Kv3.1 genes (kcnc1a and kcnc1b), one Kv3.2 gene (kcnc2), two Kv3.3 genes (kcnc3a and kcnc3b), and one Kv3.4 gene (kcnc4). Both Kv3.3 genes are expressed during early development. Zebrafish Kv3.3 channels exhibit strong functional and structural homology with mammalian Kv3.3 channels. Zebrafish Kv3.3 activates over a depolarized voltage range and deactivates rapidly. An amino-terminal extension mediates fast, N-type inactivation. The kcnc3a gene is alternatively spliced, generating variant carboxyl-terminal sequences. The R335H mutation in the S4 transmembrane segment, analogous to the SCA13 mutation R420H, eliminates functional expression. When co-expressed with wild type, R335H subunits suppress Kv3.3 activity by a dominant negative mechanism. The F363L mutation in the S5 transmembrane segment, analogous to the SCA13 mutation F448L, alters channel gating. F363L shifts the voltage range for activation in the hyperpolarized direction and dramatically slows deactivation.",Are functional effects of spinocerebellar ataxia type 13 mutations conserved in zebrafish Kv3.3 channels?,"Yes. The functional properties of zebrafish Kv3.3 channels are consistent with a role in facilitating fast, repetitive firing of action potentials in neurons.

1308,20846423,"Within the European Union the use of growth promoting agents in animal production is prohibited. Illegal use of natural prohormones like dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is hard to prove since prohormones are strongly metabolized in vivo. In the present study, we investigated the feasibility of a novel effect-based approach for monitoring abuse of DHEA. Changes in gene expression profiles were studied in livers of bull calves treated orally (PO) or intramuscularly (IM) with 1000 mg DHEA versus two control groups, using bovine 44K DNA microarrays. In contrast to controlled genomics studies, this work involved bovines purchased at the local market on three different occasions with ages ranging from 6 to 14 months, thereby reflecting the real life inter-animal variability due to differences in age, individual physiology, season and diet.
As determined by principal component analysis (PCA), large differences in liver gene expression profiles were observed between treated and control animals as well as between the two control groups. When comparing the gene expression profiles of PO and IM treated animals to that of all control animals, the number of significantly regulated genes (p-value <0.05 and a fold change >1.5) was 23 and 37 respectively. For IM and PO treated calves, gene sets were generated of genes that were significantly regulated compared to one control group and validated versus the other control group using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). This cross validation, showed that 6 out of the 8 gene sets were significantly enriched in DHEA treated animals when compared to an 'independent' control group.",Do feasibility of a liver transcriptomics approach to assess bovine treatment with the prohormone dehydroepiandrosterone ( DHEA )?,"Yes. This study showed that identification and application of genomic biomarkers for screening of (pro)hormone abuse in livestock production is substantially hampered by biological variation. On the other hand, it is demonstrated that comparison of pre-defined gene sets versus the whole genome expression profile of an animal allows to distinguish DHEA treatment effects from variations in gene expression due to inherent biological variation. Therefore, DNA-microarray expression profiling together with statistical tools like GSEA represent a promising approach to screen for (pro)hormone abuse in livestock production.

An early event in this process is the peritubular accumulation of myofibroblasts that express alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and contribute to abnormal matrix production. Common trigger factors are poorly understood. Enhanced protein trafficking may play a role by up-regulating inflammatory and fibrogenic genes in proximal tubular cells.
The remnant kidney model in rats was used to (1) analyze interactions between activated proximal tubular cells, peritubular cells expressing the myofibroblast marker, and inflammatory cells at time intervals (days 7, 14, and 30) after surgery, and (2) evaluate the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) on protein trafficking, fibrogenic signaling, and alpha-SMA expression.
Abnormal uptake of ultrafiltered proteins by proximal tubular cells (IgG staining) occurred at an early stage (day 7) and was subsequently associated with macrophage and alpha-SMA+ cell accumulation into the peritubular interstitium. alpha-SMA+ cells clustered with macrophages into the interstitium. These changes were associated with appearance of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) mRNA in proximal tubular cells and in the infiltrating cells with time. At day 30, focal alpha-SMA staining also was found in the tubular cells and in peritubular endothelial cells on semithin ultracryosections.

1314,22590653,"Blood vessels in tumors express higher level of aminopeptidase N (APN) than normal tissues. Evidence suggests that the CNGRC motif is an APN ligand which targets tumor vasculature. Increased expression of APN in tumor vascular endothelium, therefore, offers an opportunity for targeted delivery of NGR peptide-linked drugs to tumors.
To determine whether an additional cyclic CNGRC sequence could improve endothelial cell homing and antitumor effect, human plasminogen kringle 5 (hPK5) was modified genetically to introduce a CNGRC motif (NGR-hPK5) and was subsequently expressed in yeast. The biological activity of NGR-hPK5 was assessed and compared with that of wild-type hPK5, in vitro and in vivo. NGR-hPK5 showed more potent antiangiogenic activity than wild-type hPK5: the former had a stronger inhibitory effect on proliferation, migration and cord formation of vascular endothelial cells, and produced a stronger antiangiogenic response in the CAM assay. To evaluate the tumor-targeting ability, both wild-type hPK5 and NGR-hPK5 were (99 m)Tc-labeled, for tracking biodistribution in the in vivo tumor model. By planar imaging and biodistribution analyses of major organs, NGR-hPK5 was found localized to tumor tissues at a higher level than wild-type hPK5 (approximately 3-fold). Finally, the effects of wild-type hPK5 and NGR-modified hPK5 on tumor growth were investigated in two tumor model systems. NGR modification improved tumor localization and, as a consequence, effectively inhibited the growth of mouse Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) and human colorectal adenocarcinoma (Colo 205) cells in tumor-bearing mice.",Does modification of cyclic NGR tumor neovasculature-homing motif sequence to human plasminogen kringle 5 improve inhibition of tumor growth?,Yes.

The in situ RA demonstrated a typical muscular architecture, whereas RA coronary grafts showed a clear reduction of the thickness of the medial layer and had a less well-defined muscular component of the media with interposition of elastic tissue.

Defining an ""immediate virological response (IVR)"" as the loss of serum hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA 7 d after the first administration of PEG-IFN alpha, we conducted a 12-wk course of PEG-IFN alpha2a monotherapy without the addition of ribavirin for 38 patients who had low pretreatment HCV RNA load and exhibited IVR. The patients included 21 men and 17 women, whose ages ranged from 22 to 77 years (mean +/- SD: 52.0 +/- 17.8 years). There were 4 patients with HCV genotype 1b, 23 patients with genotype 2a and 4 patients with genotype 2b. HCV genotype was not determined for the remaining 7 patients. Patients were categorized into a sustained virological response (SVR) group, if serum HCV RNA remained negative for 24 wk after the end of treatment, or into a relapse group.
Based on the intention-to-treat analysis, 35 patients (92.1%) achieved SVR. One patient (2.6%) relapsed with serum HCV RNA 12 wk after the end of treatment. Two patients (5.3%) withdrew from the study during the 24-wk follow-up period. With regard to the HCV RNA genotype, the SVR rates were 100% (4/4) for genotype 1b, 95.7% (22/23) for genotype 2a and 100% (4/4) for genotype 2b.

1326,24798308,"The current standard of care for burns requiring operative treatment consists of early burn excision and autologous split-thickness skin grafting. However, in large burns, sufficient donor sites may not be available to achieve total coverage, necessitating temporary coverage with allogeneic human cadaver skin grafts or synthetic skin substitutes. A previous study from this laboratory demonstrated that skin grafts from alpha-1,3 galactosyltransferase knockout (GalT-KO) miniature swine enjoyed survival comparable to that of allogeneic skin grafts in baboons.
In the present study, we have evaluated the immune response against sequential GalT-KO and allogeneic skin grafts to determine whether such serial grafts could extend the period of temporary wound coverage before definitive grafting with autologous skin.
We report that rejection of primary GalT-KO skin grafts led to an anti-xenogeneic humoral response with no evidence for sensitization to alloantigens nor acceleration of rejection of allogeneic skin grafts. Similarly, presensitization with allogeneic skin did not lead to accelerated rejection of xenogeneic skin.","Does lack of cross-sensitization between Î±-1,3-galactosyltransferase knockout porcine and allogeneic skin grafts permit serial grafting?","Yes.

Twenty-three patients with organized glomerular Ig deposits were classified into two groups based on the fibrillar or microtubular ultrastructural appearance of the deposits. Kidney biopsy samples were studied by immunofluorescence microscopy, using anti-light chain conjugates (all cases) and anti-IgG subclass conjugates (13 patients). In each group, we studied clinicopathological features, associated monoclonal gammapathy (detected by immunoelectrophoresis and/or immunoblot) or B-cell lymphoproliferative disease, effects of chemotherapy and long-term renal outcome.
In 14 IT/MTGN and 9 FGN patients, clinical symptoms [hypertension, nephrotic syndrome (NS) and hematuria] and the mean diameters of the substructures were similar. In 13 IT/MTGN patients, glomerular (IgG1, 2 or 3) deposits were monotypic (kappa, 7 cases; lambda, 6 cases). Glomerular deposits were associated with a monoclonal Ig of the same isotype in eight patients, detected in the serum (5 cases), and/or in the cytoplasm of lymphocytes (4 cases), and with lymphoproliferative disease in seven patients. The ultrastructural features of monoclonal Ig inclusions in lymphocytes were similar to those of glomerular microtubular deposits. In contrast, none of the FGN patients presented lymphoplasmocytic proliferation or paraproteinemia.

Population-based PCa screening includes prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurement with or without a DRE. PSA and DRE screening provide greater sensitivity than PSA alone; however, the increased participation rate resulting from PSA-alone screening may result in a greater detection rate.
We performed a survey of 13,580 healthy men undergoing PSA-only population-based screening. In addition to the basic demographic information, the survey asked whether the participant would still be willing to participate in the screening if it included a DRE. We modeled the willingness to participate to assess the effect of PSA screening versus PSA and DRE screening on the basis of previously published data and our results.
The results of our study indicated that only 78% of men would participate in screening that included both DRE and PSA. Thus, 7800 men of a theoretical population of 10,000 would participate in a screening that included both DRE and PSA.

The aim of this study was to assess the autoantibody behavior in AIH and its significance as predictors of biochemical and histological remission. A total of 117 patients with AIH (mean age 18.6 [4-69] years) were evaluated and tested for autoantibodies at disease onset and successively (mean 3.2 [2-6] times) after a mean follow-up evaluation of 70 [20-185] months. Antismooth muscle (ASMA), antiliver kidney microsome type 1 (anti-LKM1), antiliver cytosol type 1 (anti-LC1), antimitochondrial, antinuclear (ANA), and antiactin antibodies (AAA) were determined at disease onset and 379 other times during the follow-up evaluation through indirect immunofluorescence in rodent tissues, HEp-2 cells, and human fibroblasts. Anti-SLA/LP were assessed 45 times in the follow-up evaluation of 19 patients using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Upon admission, AIH types 1 and 2 were observed in 95 and 17 patients, respectively. Five subjects had AIH with anti-SLA/LP as the sole markers. Patients initially negative for AAA did not develop these antibodies thereafter. ANA were detected de novo in six and three subjects with AIH types 1 and 2, respectively.

1336,23800339,"We addressed the question whether live-virus challenges could alter vaccine-induced antibody (Ab) responses in vaccinated rhesus macaques (RMs) that completely resisted repeated exposures to R5-tropic simian-human immunodeficiency viruses encoding heterologous HIV clade C envelopes (SHIV-Cs).
We examined the Ab responses in aviremic RMs that had been immunized with a multi-component protein vaccine (multimeric HIV-1 gp160, HIV-1 Tat and SIV Gag-Pol particles) and compared anti-Env plasma Ab titers before and after repeated live-virus exposures. Although no viremia was ever detected in these animals, they showed significant increases in anti-gp140 Ab titers after they had encountered live SHIVs. When we investigated the dynamics of anti-Env Ab titers during the immunization and challenge phases further, we detected the expected, vaccine-induced increases of Ab responses about two weeks after the last protein immunization. Remarkably, these titers kept rising during the repeated virus challenges, although no viremia resulted. In contrast, in vaccinated RMs that were not exposed to virus, anti-gp140 Ab titers declined after the peak seen two weeks after the last immunization. These data suggest boosting of pre-existing, vaccine-induced Ab responses as a consequence of repeated live-virus exposures. Next, we screened polyclonal plasma samples from two of the completely protected vaccinees by peptide phage display and designed a strategy that selects for recombinant phages recognized only by Abs present after - but not before - any SHIV challenge. With this ""subtractive biopanning"" approach, we isolated V3 mimotopes that were only recognized after the animals had been exposed to live virus. By detailed epitope mapping of such anti-V3 Ab responses, we showed that the challenges not only boosted pre-existing binding and neutralizing Ab titers, but also induced Abs targeting neo-antigens presented by the heterologous challenge virus.",Does live-virus exposure of vaccine-protected macaques alter the anti-HIV-1 antibody repertoire in the absence of viremia?,"Yes.

Whereas interleukin (IL)- 12 initiates the differentiation of naive Th0 cells toward Th1 phenotype, IL-4 and IL-10 mediate the development of Th2-type immunity.
Cytokines were determined before treatment by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in ascites fluid and serum of 76 patients with ovarian cancer. Cytokine levels were compared with each other and with standard clinicopathologic parameters. A stepwise logistic regression was calculated to rule out interdependence in the associations of the various variables. Survival analyses were performed with the Kaplan-Meier method and differences in survival were examined according to Mantel and Breslow. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to identify independent prognostic factors.
Whereas IL-10 and IL-12 were detectable in all ascites-fluid samples, IL-4 was measurable in only 43% of the specimens. With the exception of neopterin, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), and IL-4, determined cytokine levels were significantly elevated in ascites fluid compared with serum (P < .01). In univariate analyses, high ascitic-fluid concentrations of either neopterin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), or IL-12 were associated with poor disease-free (P < .005) and overall (P < .01) survival.

We used whole-exome sequencing and array-based comparative genomic hybridization to profile mutations and changes in copy number from 11 regions within 2 cases of ESCC and from the metastatic lymph nodes.
The numbers of somatic single nuclear polymorphisms (SNPs) in 4 regions within the tumors in case 1 and case 2 were 93Â±17 and 124Â±28, respectively. The majority of SNPs were non synonymous mutations, synonymous mutations, nonsense mutations and splicing junction mutations. The average indels in the 4 tumor regions of case 1 and case 2 were 40Â±6 and 51Â±3, respectively. These small indels mainly occurred in exonic (frame-shift and non-frame-shift), untranslational regions of genes and splicing junction regions.

SC AXC for 30 minutes results in both clotting factor consumption and activation of fibrinolytic pathways. This study was undertaken to define the hemostatic alterations that occur with longer intervals of SC AXC.
Seven pigs underwent SC AXC for 60 minutes. Five pigs that underwent infrarenal aortic cross-clamping (IR AXC) for 60 minutes and 11 pigs that underwent SC AXC for 30 minutes served as controls. No heparin was used. Blood samples were drawn at baseline, 5 minutes before release of the aortic clamp, and 5, 30, and 60 minutes after unclamping. Prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, platelet count, and fibrinogen concentration were measured as basic tests of hemostatic function. Thrombin-antithrombin complexes were used to detect the presence of intravascular thrombosis. Fibrinolytic pathway activation was assessed with levels of tissue plasminogen activator antigen and tissue plasminogen activator activity, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activity, and alpha2-antiplasmin activity. Statistical analysis was performed with the Student t test and repeated measures of analysis of variance.
Prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet count did not differ between groups at any time. Fibrinogen concentration decreased 5 minutes (P =.005) and 30 minutes (P =.006) after unclamping in both SC AXC groups, but did not change in the IR AXC group. Thrombin-antithrombin complexes increased in both SC AXC groups, but were not significantly greater than in the IR AXC group. SC AXC for both 30 and 60 minutes produced a significant increase in tissue plasminogen activator antigen during clamping and 5 minutes after clamping. This increase persisted for 30 and 60 minutes after clamp release in the 60-minute SC AXC group.

Thirty and 60 minutes of SC AXC results in similar degrees of intravascular thrombosis and fibrinogen depletion. Although SC AXC for both 30 and 60 minutes leads to activation of fibrinolytic pathways, only 60 minutes of SC AXC actually induces a fibrinolytic state.

However, HDAC inhibitors are small-molecule compounds without a specific target, and their mechanism of action is unclear. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate which HDACs are required for the proliferation and metastasis of melanoma cells.
We used overexpression and knocking down lentivirus to clarify the influence of HDAC5 and HDAC6 in melanoma development.

1348,22576962,"The development of osteoarthritis (OA) may be caused by activation of hypertrophic differentiation of articular chondrocytes. Healthy articular cartilage is highly resistant to hypertrophic differentiation, in contrast to other hyaline cartilage subtypes, such as growth plate cartilage. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the molecular mechanism responsible for the difference in the propensity of human articular cartilage and growth plate cartilage to undergo hypertrophic differentiation.
Whole-genome gene-expression microarray analysis of healthy human growth plate and articular cartilage derived from the same adolescent donors was performed. Candidate genes, which were enriched in the articular cartilage, were validated at the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels and examined for their potential to inhibit hypertrophic differentiation in two models. In addition, we studied a possible genetic association with OA.
Pathway analysis demonstrated decreased Wnt signaling in articular cartilage as compared to growth plate cartilage. This was at least partly due to increased expression of the bone morphogenetic protein and Wnt antagonists Gremlin 1, Frizzled-related protein (FRP), and Dkk-1 at the mRNA and protein levels in articular cartilage. Supplementation of these proteins diminished terminal hypertrophic differentiation without affecting chondrogenesis in long-bone explant cultures and chondrogenically differentiating human mesenchymal stem cells. Additionally, we found that single-nucleotide polymorphism rs12593365, which is located in a genomic control region of GREM1, was significantly associated with a 20% reduced risk of radiographic hip OA in 2 population-based cohorts.","Are gremlin 1 , frizzled-related protein , and Dkk-1 key regulators of human articular cartilage homeostasis?","Yes.

Perturbations by catastrophic events, however, can distort such parapatric ecological speciation processes. Here, we asked whether an exceptionally strong flood led to homogenization of gene pools among locally adapted populations of the Atlantic molly (Poecilia mexicana, Poeciliidae) in the Cueva del Azufre system in southern Mexico, where two strong environmental selection factors (darkness within caves and/or presence of toxic H2S in sulfidic springs) drive the diversification of P. mexicana. Nine nuclear microsatellites as well as heritable female life history traits (both as a proxy for quantitative genetics and for trait divergence) were used as markers to compare genetic differentiation, genetic diversity, and especially population mixing (immigration and emigration) before and after the flood.
Habitat type (i.e., non-sulfidic surface, sulfidic surface, or sulfidic cave), but not geographic distance was the major predictor of genetic differentiation. Before and after the flood, each habitat type harbored a genetically distinct population. Only a weak signal of individual dislocation among ecologically divergent habitat types was uncovered (with the exception of slightly increased dislocation from the Cueva del Azufre into the sulfidic creek, El Azufre).

Clinicopathological features and associations between increased A-A8 expression (determined by immunohistochemistry) and histologic grade were studied in a tissue microarray of 90 patients with resected stage I/II pancreatic cancer. We investigated A-A8's effect on cell migration, proliferation, and colony formation in 2 pancreatic cancer cells (BXPC-3 and Panc-1).

Notwithstanding, knowledge about the target genes mediating its biological and pathological functions remains limited. We therefore aimed to identify and characterize novel EVI1 target genes in human myeloid cells.
U937T_EVI1, a human myeloid cell line expressing EVI1 in a tetracycline regulable manner, was subjected to gene expression profiling. qRT-PCR was used to confirm the regulation of membrane-spanning-4-domains subfamily-A member-3 (MS4A3) by EVI1. Reporter constructs containing various parts of the MS4A3 upstream region were employed in luciferase assays, and binding of EVI1 to the MS4A3 promoter was investigated by chromatin immunoprecipitation. U937 derivative cell lines experimentally expressing EVI1 and/or MS4A3 were generated by retroviral transduction, and tested for their tumorigenicity by subcutaneous injection into severe combined immunodeficient mice.
Gene expression microarray analysis identified 27 unique genes that were up-regulated, and 29 unique genes that were down-regulated, in response to EVI1 induction in the human myeloid cell line U937T. The most strongly repressed gene was MS4A3, and its down-regulation by EVI1 was confirmed by qRT-PCR in additional, independent experimental model systems. MS4A3 mRNA levels were also negatively correlated with those of EVI1 in several published AML data sets. Reporter gene assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that EVI1 regulated MS4A3 via direct binding to a promoter proximal region. Experimental re-expression of MS4A3 in an EVI1 overexpressing cell line counteracted the tumor promoting effect of EVI1 in a murine xenograft model by increasing the rate of apoptosis.",Does eVI1 promote tumor growth via transcriptional repression of MS4A3?,"Yes.

Recently, we reported that CDX1 is hypermethylated in the human preeclampsia placenta. However, whether CDX1 participates in trophoblast invasion has not been clearly elucidated.
We investigated the function of CDX1 in the extravillous trophoblast cell line HTR-8/SVneo using stable transfection of CDX1. Using a CDX1 stable transfected cell line, we determined the cell invasion using a QCM ECMatrix 24-well kit. The cell viability was detected using an MTT (3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. Quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting analyses were performed to examine the changes in the expression of downstream target genes and proteins. To disrupt PI3K/AKT signaling, we used the PI3K inhibitor perifosine.
Cell invasion assays demonstrated that CDX1 restricts trophoblast cell invasiveness. In contrast, quantification of cumulative cell numbers revealed that CDX1 did not affect cell proliferation.

A novel micelle formulation of oxaliplatin (OXA) encapsulated in chitosan vesicle was developed. The authors postulate that micelle encapsulation of OXA would eliminate both CSLCs and bulk cancer cells in colorectal cancer (CRC).
In this study, using stearic acid-g-chitosan oligosaccharide (CSO-SA) polymeric micelles as a drug-delivery system, OXA-loaded CSO-SA micelles (CSO-SA/OXA) were prepared. Intracellular uptake of CSO-SA/OXA micelles was assessed by confocal microscope. The effects of free OXA, the empty carrier, and CSO-SA/OXA micelles were tested using human CRC cell lines in vitro and in vivo.
The micelles showed excellent internalization ability that increased OXA accumulation both in CRC cells and tissues. Furthermore, CSO-SA/OXA micelles could either increase the cytotoxicity of OXA against the bulk cancer cells or reverse chemoresistance of CSLC subpopulations in vitro. Intravenous administration of CSO-SA/OXA micelles effectively suppressed the tumor growth and reduced CD133+/CD24+ cell (putative CRC CSLC markers) compared with free OXA treatment, which caused CSLC enrichment in xenograft tumors (P < 0.05).",Do oxaliplatin-incorporated micelles eliminate both cancer stem-like and bulk cell populations in colorectal cancer?,Yes.

One of these dimers, p65(RelA), regulates a subclass of these targets. We have shown previously that p65 binds to the 5'-GGAA T TTTC-3' sequence asymmetrically. In that complex one subunit base specifically interacts with the preferred 5' half site and the other subunit binds non-specifically to the 3' half site.
Here we describe the crystal structures of two new p65-DNA complexes. One complex contains a pseudosymmetric 5'-GGAA T TTCC-3' DNA sequence taken from the enhancer of the gene encoding interleukin 8 (IL-8) and the other contains the asymmetric 5'-GGAA T TCCC-3' target DNA taken from the enhancer of the gene encoding type VII collagen. As expected, the global positioning of the dimer on both DNA targets is roughly symmetric, however, the hydrogen-bonding patterns at the protein-DNA interfaces differ significantly. One of the p65 monomers in complex with the asymmetric DNA binds to an extra base pair located immediately upstream of the 5'-GGAA-3' half site. We also show that p65 binds to these targets with almost equal affinity and that different residues have variable roles in binding different kappaB targets.",Does nF-kappaB p65 ( RelA ) homodimer used distinct mechanisms to recognize DNA targets?,"Yes.

1370,15564772,"The human histamine H1 receptor is constitutively active and exhibits basal activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), an important modulator of allergic inflammation. Certain H1 antihistamines have recently been shown to inhibit basal NF-kappaB activity by stabilizing the H1 receptor in an inactive state, a phenomenon called 'inverse agonism'.
We evaluated the effect of the new H1 antihistamine, desloratadine, on basal and histamine-stimulated NF-kappaB activity and compared it with the activities of other H1 antihistamines.
Transiently transfected COS-7 cells co-expressing NF-kappaB-luciferase and the H1 receptor exhibited constitutive NF-kappaB activity. H1 antihistamines reduced basal NF-kappaB activity (rank order of potency: desloratadine > pyrilamine > cetirizine > loratadine > fexofenadine). Histamine stimulated basal NF-kappaB activity 8-fold, which was blocked by H1 antihistamines (rank order of potency: desloratadine > cetirizine > pyrilamine > loratadine > fexofenadine). Neither histamine nor antihistamines had any effect on NF-kappaB activity in the absence of the H1 receptor.",Does desloratadine inhibit constitutive and histamine-stimulated nuclear factor-kappaB activity consistent with inverse agonism at the histamine H1 Receptor?,"Yes.

Medline, trial registries, conference proceedings, and article reference lists were searched to identify case series reporting sac outcomes following a specific treatment threshold for isolated type II endoleak. Articles were classified by the threshold for intervention as conservative, selective (intervention for >5-mm sac expansion or persistent type II endoleak >6 months), or aggressive (any type II endoleak or persistent for >3 months) and sac outcomes were extracted for review. Standard meta-regression to estimate the pooled odds ratios (OR), presented with the 95% confidence interval (CI), was performed to identify whether an aggressive, selective, or conservative threshold for intervention was associated with sac expansion or sac regression.
Ten series were analyzed that reported the outcomes of isolated type II endoleak in 231 patients; of these, 56 patients were treated at an aggressive threshold, 104 at a selective threshold, and 71 at a conservative threshold. The majority (194/231, 84.0%) demonstrated either stable or shrinking sacs during follow-up. No ruptures occurred.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been implicated in VSMC differentiation, but the responsible sources are unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of Nox1 and Nox4-derived ROS in this process.
Primary VSMCs were used to study the relationship between Nox homologues and differentiation markers such as smooth muscle alpha-actin (SM alpha-actin), smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SM-MHC), heavy caldesmon, and calponin. We found that Nox4 and differentiation marker genes were downregulated from passage 1 to passage 6 to 12, whereas Nox1 was gradually upregulated. Nox4 co-localized with SM alpha-actin-based stress fibers in differentiated VSMC, and moved into focal adhesions in de-differentiated cells. siRNA against nox4 reduced NADPH-driven superoxide production in serum-deprived VSMCs and downregulated SM-alpha actin, SM-MHC, and calponin, as well as SM-alpha actin stress fibers. Nox1 depletion did not decrease these parameters.",Is nox4 required for maintenance of the differentiated vascular smooth muscle cell phenotype?,Yes.

Increasing pressure was applied until the probes either slipped or reached 5 kg of force. Dissection was then performed to assess the integrity of the cricoarytenoid ligament. The forces obtained by pushing an endotracheal tube against an electronic balance were measured to estimate the maximal possible intubating force.

1390,16314597,"Idiopathic environmental intolerance (IEI), also known as multiple chemical sensitivity, is a chronic, polysymptomatic condition that cannot be explained by an organic disease. Physical and psychological complaints are believed to be sustained by low levels of chemically unrelated substances in the environment. At present, it is unclear whether IEI is an environmental illness or a variant of somatoform disorders (SFD). This study examined whether IEI can be distinguished from SFD with respect to self-reported symptoms, trait anxiety, body-related cognitions, and symptom attributions.
We compared 54 subjects with IEI, 54 subjects with SFD but without IEI, and 44 subjects with neither IEI nor SFD on symptom scales, psychological questionnaires, and structured interviews for IEI, depression, anxiety, and SFD.
More than half of the IEI subjects met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition criteria of SFD. This group shared both symptoms and psychological features of somatization with the SFD group. IEI subjects who did not fulfill criteria for a specific SFD were less impaired by their chemical sensitivity but differed nevertheless from nonsomatoform controls by significantly higher symptom scores, higher trait anxiety, a focus on autonomic sensations, and more pronounced somatic symptom attributions. These psychological features were significantly associated with the burden of somatic symptoms in both SFD and IEI. Furthermore, self-reported allergy but not total immunoglobulin E correlated with symptom burden in the total sample.",Do evidence for overlap between idiopathic environmental intolerance and somatoform disorders?,Yes.

This occurs due to an aberrant vasculature as well as high rates of glycolysis and lactate production in tumor cells even in the presence of oxygen (the Warburg effect), which weakens the spatial linkage between hypoxia and acidosis.
Five different human squamous cell carcinoma cell lines (SiHa, FaDuDD, UTSCC5, UTSCC14 and UTSCC15) were treated with hypoxia, acidosis (pH 6.3), or a combination, and gene expression analyzed using microarray. SiHa and FaDuDD were chosen for further characterization of cell energetics and protein synthesis. Total cellular ATP turnover and relative glycolytic dependency was determined by simultaneous measurements of oxygen consumption and lactate synthesis rates and total protein synthesis was determined by autoradiographic quantification of the incorporation of 35S-labelled methionine and cysteine into protein.
Microarray analysis allowed differentiation between genes induced at low oxygen only at normal extracellular pH (pHe), genes induced at low oxygen at both normal and low pHe, and genes induced at low pHe independent of oxygen concentration. Several genes were found to be upregulated by acidosis independent of oxygenation.

Although positive and negative effects of MIF on tumor cell growth have been reported, to the authors' knowledge the precise role of MIF in tumorigenesis remains unclear. In the current study the authors assessed expression of MIF protein and mRNA in lung adenocarcinomas with regard to patient prognosis.
Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on tissue specimens surgically obtained from 74 patients with primary lung adenocarcinoma (American Joint Committee on Cancer pathologic Stages I, II, and IIIa). In addition, expression of MIF mRNA in the cancerous tissue was investigated using in situ hybridization. Patient prognosis was evaluated with regard to MIF expression levels and its distribution was analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier method.
MIF mRNA and MIF protein were observed in the bronchial epithelium, alveolar epithelium, vascular smooth muscle, and alveolar macrophages in the normal lung tissue. In tumor tissue from lung adenocarcinoma specimens, both MIF mRNA and protein were observed at much higher levels than in the normal alveolar epithelium. MIF protein was observed diffusely in the cytoplasm of tumor cells in all tumor specimens examined.

1405,26243800,"Chronic elevation of 3'-5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels has been associated with cardiac remodeling and cardiac hypertrophy. However, enhancement of particular aspects of cAMP/protein kinase A signaling seems to be beneficial for the failing heart. cAMP is a pleiotropic second messenger with the ability to generate multiple functional outcomes in response to different extracellular stimuli with strict fidelity, a feature that relies on the spatial segregation of the cAMP pathway components in signaling microdomains.
How individual cAMP microdomains affect cardiac pathophysiology remains largely to be established. The cAMP-degrading enzymes phosphodiesterases (PDEs) play a key role in shaping local changes in cAMP. Here we investigated the effect of specific inhibition of selected PDEs on cardiac myocyte hypertrophic growth.
Using pharmacological and genetic manipulation of PDE activity, we found that the rise in cAMP resulting from inhibition of PDE3 and PDE4 induces hypertrophy, whereas increasing cAMP levels via PDE2 inhibition is antihypertrophic. By real-time imaging of cAMP levels in intact myocytes and selective displacement of protein kinase A isoforms, we demonstrate that the antihypertrophic effect of PDE2 inhibition involves the generation of a local pool of cAMP and activation of a protein kinase A type II subset, leading to phosphorylation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells.",Does cardiac Hypertrophy be Inhibited by a Local Pool of cAMP Regulated by Phosphodiesterase 2?,"Yes.

Hemorrhagic severity was assessed using the World Federation of Neurological Surgeons (WFNS) scale and modified Fisher grading scale. Unfavorable outcome was defined as Glasgow outcome scale score of 1-3. Prognostic predictors of 6-month mortality and unfavorable outcome were identified using multivariate analysis.
The serum CXCL12 levels were significantly higher in patients as compared to controls (14.5Â±6.7ng/mL vs. 1.7Â±0.6ng/mL, P<0.001) and were independently associated with WFNS scores (t=5.927, P<0.001) and modified Fisher scores (t=5.506, P<0.001). Serum CXCL12 levels predicted 6-month mortality and 6-month unfavorable outcome with the area under curves of 0.815 [95% confidence (CI), 0.751-0.868] and 0.809 (95% CI, 0.745-0.864) respectively and were related independently to 6-month mortality (odds ratio, 4.428; 95% CI, 1.977-12.031; P=0.004) and 6-month unfavorable outcome (odds ratio, 3.821; 95% CI, 1.097-9.251; P=0.001). Moreover, the predictive values of CXCL12 levels were in the range of WFNS scores and modified Fisher scores.",Does elevation of serum CXC chemokine ligand-12 levels predict poor outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage?,"Yes. Elevation of serum CXCL12 levels is associated highly with hemorrhagic severity and poor outcome after aSAH, suggesting CXCL12 might have the potential to be a prognostic predictive biomarker of aSAH.",PASS,pubmedQA," Yes, elevated serum CXC chemokine ligand-12 levels may predict a poor outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.","onset of dyspnea, patients usually progressed to respiratory failure or hypoxemia.

Despite large increases in fat mass (FM), recent evidence indicates that fat-free mass (FFM) rather than FM is positively associated with intake in humans.
In 184 humans (73 females/111 males; age 34.5Â±8.8 years; percentage body fat: 31.6Â±8.1%), we investigated the relationship of FFM index (FFMI, kgâ€‰m(-2)), FM index (FMI, kgâ€‰m(-2)); and 24-h energy expenditure (EE, n=127) with ad-libitum food intake using a 3-day vending machine paradigm. Mean daily calories (CAL) and macronutrient intake (PRO, CHO, FAT) were determined and used to calculate the relative caloric contribution of each (%PRO, %CHO, %FAT) and percent of caloric intake over weight maintaining energy needs (%WMENs).
FFMI was positively associated with CAL (P<0.0001), PRO (P=0.0001), CHO (P=0.0075) and FAT (P<0.0001). This remained significant after adjusting for FMI. Total EE predicted CAL and macronutrient intake (all P<0.0001). FMI was positively associated with CAL (P=0.019), PRO (P=0.025) and FAT (P=0.0008). In models with both FFMI and FMI, FMI was negatively associated with CAL (P=0.019) and PRO (P=0.033).

Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) have shown promising antitumor activities against preclinical models of pancreatic cancer, either alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic agents. In this study, we sought to identify clinically relevant histone deacetylases (HDACs) to guide the selection of HDAC inhibitors (HDACIs) tailored to the treatment of pancreatic cancer.
HDAC expression in seven pancreatic cancer cell lines and normal human pancreatic ductal epithelial cells was determined by Western blotting. Antitumor interactions between class I- and class II-selective HDACIs were determined by MTT assays and standard isobologram/CompuSyn software analyses. The effects of HDACIs on cell death, apoptosis and cell cycle progression, and histone H4, alpha-tubulin, p21, and Î³H2AX levels were determined by colony formation assays, flow cytometry analysis, and Western blotting, respectively.
The majority of classes I and II HDACs were detected in the pancreatic cancer cell lines, albeit at variable levels. Treatments with MGCD0103 (a class I-selective HDACI) resulted in dose-dependent growth arrest, cell death/apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase, accompanied by induction of p21 and DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). In contrast, MC1568 (a class IIa-selective HDACI) or Tubastatin A (a HDAC6-selective inhibitor) showed minimal effects. When combined simultaneously, MC1568 significantly enhanced MGCD0103-induced growth arrest, cell death/apoptosis, and G2/M cell cycle arrest, while Tubastatin A only synergistically enhanced MGCD0103-induced growth arrest. Although MC1568 or Tubastatin A alone had no obvious effects on DNA DSBs and p21 expression, their combination with MGCD0103 resulted in cooperative induction of p21 in the cells.",Are class I and class II histone deacetylases potential therapeutic targets for treating pancreatic cancer?,"Yes.

In-vitro studies were conducted on effect of lead alone and lead+WRE on rat-isolated portal vein while in-vivo studies were done in three groups of 12 rats each; Group-II and III received 0.5% lead acetate and 1.0% WRE + 0.5% lead acetate, respectively, in drinking water for 12 weeks whereas group-I served as control. Adrenaline and noradrenaline levels in brain and blood were determined by HPLC assay while vascular reactivity of portal vein to lead and WRE was determined by measuring the isometric tension.
Following in-vitro exposure, lead did not alter the contractile effect of phenylephrine. In-vivo studies revealed that contractile effect of lead on portal vein was significantly potentiated and it was antagonized by prazosin (10(-7) M) and WRE (1%). WRE treatment significantly reduced elevated blood noradrenaline (37.80%) and restored noradrenaline level in brain (39.39%) in lead-exposed animals.

Innate defense mechanisms at the mucosal surface are critical in protecting the host from airborne environmental pathogens. Recent studies of skin and gastrointestinal tract inflammatory diseases have shown that stimulation of the interleukin-22 receptor (IL-22R1) nonspecifically increases innate immune responses. The potential role of IL-22R1 in the pathogenesis of CRSwNP has never been explored.
Prospective.
Nine controls and 19 subjects with CRS were prospectively enrolled prior to undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery. Nasal epithelial cells were cultured from surgically obtained ethmoid mucosa and IL-22R1 protein expression was examined via flow cytometry.

By analyzing ChIP-Seq datasets, we demonstrate that the positions occupied by Myc-Max across the human genome correlate with the RNA polymerase II, Pol II, transcription machinery significantly better than with E-boxes. Metagene analyses show that in promoter regions, Myc is uniformly positioned about 100 bp upstream of essentially all promoter proximal paused polymerases with Max about 15 bp upstream of Myc. We re-evaluate the DNA binding properties of full length Myc-Max proteins. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay results demonstrate Myc-Max heterodimers display significant sequence preference, but have high affinity for any DNA. Quantification of the relative affinities of Myc-Max for all possible 8-mers using universal protein-binding microarray assays shows that sequences surrounding core 6-mers significantly affect binding.

We assessed the effect of SAMe on the kinetics of the early antiviral response and interferon signaling in nonresponders to previous antiviral therapy and investigated the mechanisms involved.
Nonresponders with HCV genotype 1 were given peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin for 2 weeks (course A, baseline/control). After 1 month, patients received SAMe (1600 mg daily) for 2 weeks and then peginterferon and ribavirin for 48 weeks (course B; completed by 21 of 24 patients). Viral kinetics and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were compared between courses.
The decrease in HCV RNA from 0 to 48 hours (phase 1) was similar with and without SAMe.

All hospitalised adult patients with PUD in the capital region of Finland were included. The data were linked with nationwide Prescription Register of the Finnish Social Insurance Institution allowing detailed individual medicine purchase data.
A total of 9951 peptic ulcers were detected among 8146 individual patients during the study period. The mean annual incidence of all peptic ulcers decreased from 121/100,000 (95% CI: 117-125) in 2000-2002, to 79 (95% CI: 76-82) in 2006-2008 [Incidence rate ratio = 0.62 (95% CI: 0.58-0.64), P < 0.001 after age and sex adjustment]. Decrease in incidence was seen in all age groups and in both sexes. The overall rate of severe complications of PUD was reduced. One-year cumulative incidence of recurrent ulcers was 13%. Use of several drugs was associated with increased risk for recurrence. The purchases of various drugs were more common among PUD patients compared with background population.",Do incidence and complications of peptic ulcer disease requiring hospitalisation have markedly decreased in Finland?,Yes. Both the incidence and complication rates have markedly decreased during the study period.

We screened six candidate genes (CAV1, KCNJ2, KCNQ1, NKX2.5, PITX2, and TBX5) for novel mutations in 139 patients of Chinese descent with early-onset AF and 576 controls. Four missense TBX5 mutations, p.R355C, p.Q376R, p.A428S, and p.S372L, were identified in evolutionarily conserved regions. We did not find any mutations in CAV1, KCNJ2, KCNQ1, NKX2.5, and PITX2.

1445,16965580,"Most alloantigens on transfused red blood cells (RBCs) are weakly immunogenic, with only a 2 to 6 percent overall immunization rate even in patients receiving multiple transfusions. Although recipient genetics may contribute to responder and/or nonresponder status, in most cases HLA type does not predict humoral response to RBC antigens. In contrast, rates of alloimmunization do correspond to the underlying disease status of transfusion recipients, suggesting that acquired host factors may play an important role. In this context, it was hypothesized that the inflammatory status of a transfusion recipient would influence immunization to transfused RBCs.
A novel murine model for alloimmunization to RBC antigens was developed with the mHEL mouse, which expresses hen egg lysozyme (HEL) as a model blood group antigen. Leukoreduced mHEL RBCs were transfused into wild-type recipient mice, and anti-HEL responses were monitored. To test the stated hypothesis, some recipient animals were injected with polyinosinic polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), a synthetic double-stranded RNA molecule that induces viral-like inflammation.
Similar to the immunogenicity of most RBC antigens in humans, transfusion of mHEL RBCs into uninflamed mice was only a weak immunogen. In contrast, poly(I:C)-treated mice had a significant increase in both the frequency and the magnitude of alloimmunization to the mHEL antigen.",Does recipient inflammation affect the frequency and magnitude of immunization to transfused red blood cells?,"Yes.

Î³-Secretase, or its catalytic subunit presenilin 1 (PS1), were upregulated by exposure to either pigment epithelial derived factor (PEDF) or an AAV2 vector containing a PS1 gene driven by a vascular endothelial-cadherin promoter. Retinal endothelial cells were infected with AAV2 or exposed to PEDF in the presence or absence of VEGF and in vitro angiogenesis determined. Mouse eyes either received intravitreal injection of PEDF, DAPT (a Î³-secretase inhibitor) or PEDF + DAPT at the time of laser injury, or AAV2 infection 3 weeks before receiving laser burns. Lesion volume was determined 14 days post laser injury. Superoxide generation, antioxidant activity and the production of proinflammatory mediators were assessed. Knockdown of Î³-secretase was achieved using siRNA.
Î³-Secretase upregulation and PS1 overexpression suppressed VEGF-induced in vitro angiogenesis and in vivo laser-induced CNV. This was associated with a reduction in the expression of VEGF and angiogenin 1 together with reduced superoxide anion generation and an increase in MnSOD compared with untreated CNV eyes.

1447,24664750,"Because retina-damaging angiogenesis is controlled by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and people with higher glucose intakes are more susceptible to retinal complications that may be due to increased VEGF, it is crucial to elucidate relations between glucose exposure and VEGF expression. We aimed to determine if a carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP) plays a role in the transcriptional up-regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1Î± (HIF-1Î±) and the downstream VEGF expression in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells exposed to high glucose under normoxic conditions.
ARPE19 cells were exposed to 5.6, 11, 17, 25 and 30 mM glucose for 48 h in serum-free culture media under normoxic (21â€‰% O2) conditions. Protein and mRNA expression of indicated genes were determined by immunoblot analyses and real-time RT-PCR, respectively. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect the concentrations of VEGF in the media. Immunofluorescence (IF) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) for ChREBP were used to demonstrate nuclear translocation and HIF-1Î± gene promoter association, respectively.
Immunoblot analyses showed that HIF-1Î± levels were positively related to levels of glucose exposure between 5.6-25 mM in the RPE cells, indicating the induction and stabilization of HIF-1Î± by elevated glucose under normoxic conditions. Human lens epithelial cells and HeLa cells did not respond to high glucose, implying that this phenomenon is cell type-specific. Real-time RT-PCR for HIF-1Î± and VEGF and ELISA for VEGF indicated that high glucose is associated with elevated production of HIF-1Î±-induced VEGF, an established inducer of neovascularization, in the RPE cells. IF analyses showed that, although ChREBP was expressed under both low (5.6 mM) and high (25 mM) glucose conditions, it appeared more in the nuclear region than in the cytosol of the RPE cells after the high glucose treatment. ChIP analyses suggested a HIF-1Î± gene promoter association with ChREBP under the high glucose condition. These results imply that RPE cells use cytosolic ChREBP as a glucose sensor to up-regulate HIF-1Î± expression.",Does high glucose activate ChREBP-mediated HIF-1Î± and VEGF expression in human RPE cells under normoxia?,"Yes.

The lipid-lowering drug simvastatin decreases portal pressure, improves hepatocellular function, and might reduce liver fibrosis. We assessed whether adding simvastatin to standard therapy could reduce rebleeding and death after variceal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis.
We performed a multicenter, double-blind, parallel trial of 158 patients with cirrhosis receiving standard prophylaxis to prevent rebleeding (a Î²-blocker and band ligation) in Spain from October 2010 through October 2013. Within 10 days of bleeding, subjects were randomly assigned, but stratified by Child-Pugh class of A or B vs C, to groups given simvastatin (20 mg/d the first 15 days, 40 mg/d thereafter; nÂ = 69) or placebo (nÂ = 78).

Despite its frequent association with atherosclerosis, compelling studies have shown striking differences and potentially opposite roles of T-cell helper responses in aneurysm as compared with atherosclerosis, casting doubt on the relevance and suitability of T-cell-targeted therapies in this context.
Here, we show that selective depletion of T regulatory (Treg) cells using a CD25-specific monoclonal antibody significantly enhances the susceptibility of C57Bl/6 mice to angiotensin II-induced abdominal aortic aneurysm and promotes aortic rupture (n=25-44 mice/group). Similar results are observed in angiotensin II-treated Cd80(-/-)/Cd86(-/-) or Cd28(-/-) mice with impaired Treg cell homeostasis (n=18-23 mice/group).

1454,22882997,"Giardia duodenalis is a common protozoan parasite of humans and animals. Genetic characterization of single loci indicates the existence of eight groups called assemblages, which differ in their host distribution. Molecular analyses challenged the idea that G. duodenalis is a strictly clonal diplomonad by providing evidence of recombination within and between assemblages. Particularly, inter-assemblage recombination events would complicate the interpretation of multi-locus genotyping data from field isolates: where is a host infected with multiple Giardia genotypes or with a single, recombined Giardia genotype.
Population genetic analyses on the single and multiple-locus level on an extensive dataset of G. duodenalis isolates from humans and animals were performed.
Our analyses indicate that recombination between isolates from different assemblages are apparently very rare or absent in the natural population of Giardia duodenalis. At the multi-locus level, our statistical analyses are more congruent with clonal reproduction and can equally well be explained with the presence of multiple G. duodenalis genotypes within one field isolate.",Is population-based analyses of Giardia duodenalis consistent with the clonal assemblage structure?,Yes.

In this study, we explored the contribution of six GRIN2B markers to DD and key DD-related phenotypes by association analyses in a sample of Italian nuclear families. Moreover, we assessed potential gene-by-environment interactions on DD-related phenotypes.
We carried out a family-based association study to determine whether the GRIN2B gene influences both DD as a categorical trait and its related cognitive traits in a large cohort of 466 Italian nuclear families ascertained through a proband affected by DD.

PAPC influences cell-cell adhesion mediated by C-Cadherin. A putative direct adhesion activity of PAPC is discussed.

We have used biochemical and genetic approaches to study the role of a Smyd protein in Drosophila. We identified eleven Drosophila genes that encode Smyd proteins. CG14122 encodes a Smyd4 homologue that we have named dSmyd4. dSmyd4 repressed transcription and recruited class I histone deacetylases (HDACs). A region of dSmyd4 including the MYND domain interacted directly with approximately 150 amino acids at the N-termini of dHDAC1 and dHDAC3. dSmyd4 interacts selectively with Ebi, a component of the dHDAC3/SMRTER co-repressor complex. During embryogenesis dSmyd4 was expressed throughout the mesoderm, with highest levels in the somatic musculature. Muscle-specific RNAi against dSmyd4 resulted in depletion of the protein and lead to severe lethality. Eclosion is the final moulting stage of Drosophila development when adult flies escape from the pupal case. 80% of dSmyd4 knockdown flies were not able to eclose, resulting in late pupal lethality. However, many aspects of eclosion were still able to occur normally, indicating that dSmyd4 is likely to be involved in the development or function of adult muscle.",Is a Drosophila Smyd4 homologue a muscle-specific transcriptional modulator involved in development?,Yes.

However, little is known about the Ank protein function in O. tsutsugamushi.
To characterize the function of Ank proteins, we investigated a group of Ank proteins containing an F-box-like domain in the C-terminus in addition to the Ank domains. All nine selected ank genes were expressed at the transcriptional level in host cells infected with O. tsutsugamushi, and specific antibody responses against three Ank proteins were detected in the serum from human patients, indicating an active expression of the bacterial Ank proteins post infection. When ectopically expressed in HeLa cells, the Ank proteins of O. tsutsugamushi were consistently found in the nucleus and/or cytoplasm. In GST pull-down assays, multiple Ank proteins specifically interacted with Cullin1 and Skp1, core components of the SCF1 ubiquitin ligase complex, as well as the eukaryotic elongation factor 1 Î± (EF1Î±).

Both times they took paracetamol (1.5 g together with a standardized breakfast) and drank ethanol (0.3 g/kg) 1 h after eating breakfast. On one drinking occasion, no previous medication was given. The other alcohol session was performed after the subjects had taken 75 mg ASA once daily for 7 days. On both occasions, venous blood samples were obtained at exactly timed intervals for a period of 3.5 h.
The blood-ethanol profiles showed large interindividual variations for both experiments. After treatment with ASA, the maximum blood-ethanol concentration was distinctly lower in seven subjects, almost unchanged in two subjects and increased in one subject. Overall, a statistically significant decrease in the peak blood-ethanol concentration was observed. The time required to reach peak blood-ethanol levels was somewhat longer after treatment with ASA. Although the areas under the concentration-time profiles were smaller after ASA treatment, these differences were not statistically significant. The concentrations of paracetamol in plasma were lower when ethanol was ingested after treatment with ASA and the areas under the concentration-time curves (0-170 min) were smaller.",Does low-dose aspirin decrease blood alcohol concentrations by delaying gastric emptying?,"Yes.

We performed a structure-function analysis of the chitin-binding domains encoded by the chiA gene, which mediates the pathogenic effects of adherent invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC).
We created AIEC (strain LF82) with deletion of chiA (LF82-Î”chiA) or that expressed chiA with specific mutations. We investigated the effects of infecting different IEC lines with these bacteria compared with nonpathogenic E coli; chitinase activities were measured using the colloidal chitin-azure method. Colitis was induced in C57/Bl6 mice by administration of dextran sodium sulfate, and mice were given 10(8) bacteria for 15 consecutive days by gavage. Stool/tissue samples were collected and analyzed.
LF82-Î”chiA had significantly less adhesion to IEC lines than LF82. Complementation of LF82-Î”chiA with the LF82 chiA gene, but not chiA from nonpathogenic (K12) E coli, increased adhesion. We identified 5 specific polymorphisms in the chitin-binding domain of LF82 chiA (at amino acids 362, 370, 378, 388, and 548) that differ from chiA of K12 and were required for LF82 to interact directly with IECs. This interaction was mediated by an N-glycosylated asparagine in chitinase 3-like-1 (amino acid 68) on IECs.

1480,24884438,"Plant growth is plastic, able to rapidly adjust to fluctuation in environmental conditions such as drought and salinity. Due to long-term irrigation use in agricultural systems, soil salinity is increasing; consequently crop yield is adversely affected. It is known that salt tolerance is a quantitative trait supported by genes affecting ion homeostasis, ion transport, ion compartmentalization and ion selectivity. Less is known about pathways connecting NaCl and cell proliferation and cell death. Plant growth and cell proliferation is, in part, controlled by the concerted activity of the heterotrimeric G-protein complex with glucose. Prompted by the abundance of stress-related, functional annotations of genes encoding proteins that interact with core components of the Arabidopsis heterotrimeric G protein complex (AtRGS1, AtGPA1, AGB1, and AGG), we tested the hypothesis that G proteins modulate plant growth under salt stress.
Na+ activates G signaling as quantitated by internalization of Arabidopsis Regulator of G Signaling protein 1 (AtRGS1). Despite being components of a singular signaling complex loss of the GÎ² subunit (agb1-2 mutant) conferred accelerated senescence and aborted development in the presence of Na+, whereas loss of AtRGS1 (rgs1-2 mutant) conferred Na+ tolerance evident as less attenuated shoot growth and senescence. Site-directed changes in the GÎ± and GÎ²Î³ protein-protein interface were made to disrupt the interaction between the GÎ± and GÎ²Î³ subunits in order to elevate free activated GÎ± subunit and free GÎ²Î³ dimer at the plasma membrane. These mutations conferred sodium tolerance. Glucose in the growth media improved the survival under salt stress in Col but not in agb1-2 or rgs1-2 mutants.",Is growth attenuation under saline stress mediated by the heterotrimeric G protein complex?,"Yes. These results demonstrate a direct role for G-protein signaling in the plant growth response to salt stress. The contrasting phenotypes of agb1-2 and rgs1-2 mutants suggest that G-proteins balance growth and death under salt stress.

Here, we show that the FXR agonist, obeticholic acid (OCA), increases fecal cholesterol excretion and macrophage reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) dependent on activation of hepatic FXR. OCA does not increase biliary cholesterol secretion, but inhibits intestinal cholesterol absorption. OCA markedly inhibits hepatic cholesterol 7Î±-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1) and sterol 12Î±-hydroxylase (Cyp8b1) partly through inducing small heterodimer partner, leading to reduced bile acid pool size and altered bile acid composition, with the Î±/Î²-muricholic acid proportion in bile increased by 2.6-fold and taurocholic acid (TCA) level reduced by 71%.

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between lifetime sport and leisure activity participation on bone material and structural properties at the axial and appendicular skeleton in older men (>50 years).
We used dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to assess hip, spine and ultradistal (UD) radius areal bone mineral density (aBMD) (n=161), quantitative ultrasound (QUS) to measure heel bone quality (n=161), and quantitative computed tomography (QCT) to assess volumetric BMD, bone geometry and strength at the spine (L(1)-L(3)) and mid-femur (n=111). Current (>50+ years) and past hours of sport and leisure activity participation during adolescence (13-18 years) and adulthood (19-50 years) were assessed by questionnaire. This information was used to calculate the total time (min) spent participating in sport and leisure activities and an osteogenic index (OI) score for each participant, which provides a measure of participation in weight-bearing activities.
Regression analysis revealed that a greater lifetime (13-50+ years) and mid-adulthood (19-50 years) OI, but not total time (min), was associated with a greater mid-femur total and cortical area, cortical bone mineral content (BMC), and the polar moment of inertia (I (p)) and heel VOS (p ranging from <0.05 to <0.01). These results were independent of age, height (or femoral length) and weight (or muscle cross-sectional area). Adolescent OI scores were not found to be significant predictors of bone structure or strength. Furthermore, no significant relationships were detected with areal or volumetric BMD at any site. Subjects were then categorized into either a high (H) or low/non-impact (L) group during adolescence (13-18 years) and adulthood (19-50+ years) according to their OI scores during each of these periods. Three groups were subsequently formed to reflect weight-bearing impact categories during adolescence and then adulthood: LL, HL and HH.

Genetic regions associated with susceptibility to trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis were identified in a genome-wide linkage analysis in F2 progeny of colitis-susceptible SJL/J and -resistant C57BL/6 mice. An immunogenetic approach was then used to further study the pathophysiologic role of one of the identified loci.
We identified susceptibility loci on chromosomes 9 (Tnbs1) and 11 (Tnbs2). Tnbs2 harbors the interleukin (IL)-12 p40 gene, a likely candidate gene because IL-12 is a known central mediator for both experimental colitis and human Crohn's disease. We therefore tested the ability of colitis-susceptible and -resistant strains to mount IL-12 responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a strong inducer of IL-12 that is abundantly present in the intestine. We observed a remarkably higher serum IL-12 response to LPS in susceptible SJL/J mice.

In the present analysis, we sought to evaluate the potential association of HFSR and survival in German patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and locally advanced rectal cancer treated with cape in clinical trials.
Patients of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft fÃ¼r Internistische Onkologie (AIO) KRK-0104 and the Mannheim rectal cancer trial were evaluated. HFSR was graded according to NCI-CTC criteria in both trials. Time to first occurrence of HFSR was described per cycle and HFSR developing during cycles 1 and 2 was defined as 'early HFSR'. Baseline characteristics between the patient groups with or without HFSR were compared using Mann-Whitney-U, Fisher's exact or Ï‡(2)-test, as appropriate. Haematological and non-haematological toxicities observed in both groups were compared using Fisher's exact test. Progression-free (PFS) or disease-free (DFS) as well as overall survival (OS) data from both trials were pooled and the HFSR group was compared with the non-HFSR using Kaplan-Meier analysis.
A total of 374 patients were included, of whom 29.3% developed any HFSR. Of these, 51% had early HFSR. Baseline characteristics were comparable between both HFSR groups concerning age, gender, ECOG performance status and UICC stage. On multivariate analysis none of these factors had influence on the occurrence of HFSR. The percentage of all-grade (and grade 3-4) haematological toxicities did not differ between both the groups. By contrast, patients exhibiting HFSR had a significantly higher rate of all-grade (but not grade 3-4) diarrhoea, stomatitis/mucositis and fatigue (P<0.01, respectively).

1499,11593522,"To summarize the major achievements of Chinese work on the epidemiology and prevention of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in recent years, and to give a general review on the present situation of HFRS in China.
Reviews and papers published in Chinese journals, relevant to the objectives, written or collected by the author; and the research work of the author.
An outline was drafted according to the purpose given above, and the relevant materials and data were grouped together into different items outlined.
All the materials and data extracted were published or specially assessed.
HFRS was first recognized in the northeastern China in 1931. It has been found prevalent also in many other parts of China since 1955, and presently, 28 out of 31 provinces (autonomous regions, or municipalities) have been proved to be its endemic areas. The total number of cases is 1,256,431 from 1950 to 1997, with 44,304 death (3.53%). 50-100 thousands of cases could be registered annually since 1981 when the presence of the Rattus-type HFRS was first identified serologically in China, with the highest peak in 1986 (115,985 cases). Three types of endemicity have been differentiated: the Apodemus-type, the Rattus-type and the mixed type of the two, by their peculiar seasonal distributions of cases and by methods of serotyping (HI, MAbs serotyping kits). The epidemiologic features of the Rattus-type HFRS are quite different from that of the Apodemus-type. 67 species of vertebrates were found to harbor hantavirus antigen or antibodies, but the chief or primary reservoir hosts are Apodemus agrarius and Rattus norvegicus only. Besides the commonly recognized enzootic mode of transmission (via contacts with the reservoir rodents or their excreta), mite transmission (including certain species of gamasid mites, and chigger mites) has been identified as the potential vectors and reservoir hosts with HFRS. Vertical transmission had been found in pregnant patients with HFRS, and in all three chief host rodents (Apodemus agrarius, Rattus norvegicus, the laboratory rats). The relatively high inapparent infection rates in the population of endemic areas of the Rattus-type HFRS after big outbreaks (8%-20%) are suggested to play a significant role in the gradual decline of the incidence of HFRS in that areas. Three kinds of inactivated vaccines against HFRS (the golden hamster kidney cell vaccine, the Mongolian gerbil kidney cell vaccine and the purified suckling mouse brain vaccine) have been successively developed and proved highly effective in the prevention of HFRS.",Does epidemiological progress of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in China?,"Yes. Chinese workers on the epidemiology and prevention of HFRS in China have accomplished great achievements since 1981. As the relatively high annual incidence of HFRS sustained in recent years, control measures have to be reinforced. Many problems of HFRS and hantavirus infections are still not well understood or unclear, such as the poly-host nature, and the multi-modes of transmission, the natural history of hantaviruses and their genetic variation occurred in nature etc. The task for effective control of HFRS and the research on its epidemiology in China should be held on a high priority.",PASS,pubmedQA," The majority of reported cases of Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS) in China have been mild, as per the evidence from published case series.","consistent with the evidence from Chinese case series published so far although the majority of infections in China have been mild [22, 23] .

The studies selected were clinical trials comparing the efficacy of dexamethasone with prednisone. Meta-analysis was performed examining physician revisitation rates and symptomatic return to baseline.
Six completed pediatric clinical trials met the inclusion criteria.

Abridged lifetables for the period 1999-2003 were constructed using standard demographic methods for each of four ethnic groups (Asian, Pacific, Maori and European) by NZDep2001 quintile and sex. Gradients were estimated by fitting generalised linear models to the quintile-specific life expectancy estimates for each ethnic group (by sex). The contribution of variation in deprivation distributions to inter-ethnic inequalities in life expectancy was estimated by re-weighting the quintile-specific mortality rates for each ethnic group using weights derived from the European deprivation distribution and recalculating the lifetable.

1517,21801416,"It is now widely accepted that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a critical regulator of energy homeostasis. Recently, it has been shown to regulate circadian clocks. In seasonal breeding species such as sheep, the circadian clock controls the secretion of an endogenous rhythm of melatonin and, as a consequence, is probably involved in the generation of seasonal rhythms of reproduction. Considering this, we identified the presence of the subunits of AMPK in different hypothalamic nuclei involved in the pre- and post-pineal pathways that control seasonality of reproduction in the ewe and we investigated if the intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of two activators of AMPK, metformin and AICAR, affected the circadian rhythm of melatonin in ewes that were housed in constant darkness. In parallel the secretion of insulin was monitored as a peripheral metabolic marker. We also investigated the effects of i.c.v. AICAR on the phosphorylation of AMPK and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), a downstream target of AMPK, in brain structures along the photoneuroendocrine pathway to the pineal gland.
All the subunits of AMPK that we studied were identified in all brain areas that were dissected but with some differences in their level of expression among structures. Metformin and AICAR both reduced (p<0.001 and p<0.01 respectively) the amplitude of the circadian rhythm of melatonin secretion independently of insulin secretion. The i.c.v. injection of AICAR only tended (p = 0.1) to increase the levels of phosphorylated AMPK in the paraventricular nucleus but significantly increased the levels of phosphorylated ACC in the paraventricular nucleus (p<0.001) and in the pineal gland (p<0.05).",The effect of an intracerebroventricular injection of metformin or AICAR on the plasma concentrations of melatonin in the ewe: potential involvement of AMPK?,"Yes.

To determine the hemodynamic effect due to lung IR injury, we performed a quantitative coronary blood-flow analysis in a swine model of in situ lung ischemia and reperfusion.
In 14 healthy pigs, blood flow was measured in the ascending aorta, left anterior descending (LAD), circumflex (Cx), right coronary artery (RCA), right common carotid artery (RCCA), and left internal mammary artery (LIMA), along with left-and right-ventricular pressures (LVP and RVP), aortic pressure (AoP), and pulmonary artery pressure (PAP). Cardiac Troponin (cTn), interleukin 6 and 10 (IL-6 and IL-10), and tumor necrosis factor A (TNF-A) were measured in coronary sinus blood samples. The experimental (IR) group (n=10) underwent 60 min of lung ischemia followed by 60 min of reperfusion by clamping and releasing the left pulmonary hilum. Simultaneous measurements of all parameters were made at baseline and during IR. The control group (n=4) had similar measurements without lung IR.
In the IR group, total coronary flow (TCF=LAD+Cx+RCA blood-flow) decreased precipitously and significantly from baseline (113Â±41 ml min""1) during IR (p<0.05), with the lowest value observed at 60 min of reperfusion (-37.1%, p<0.003).

Histologic and ultrastructural studies of normal corneas showed significant differences in the direction of collagen fibrils and/or the degree of lamellar interweaving in Bowman's layer, the anterior third of the corneal stroma, the posterior two-thirds of the corneal stroma, and Descemet's membrane. Cohesive tensile strength testing directly supported these morphologic findings as the stronger, more rigid regions of the cornea were located anteriorly and peripherally. This suggests that PRK and ASA, and secondarily SBK, should be biomechanically safer than conventional LASIK with regard to risk for causing keratectasia after surgery. Because adult human corneal stromal wounds heal slowly and incompletely, all excimer laser keratorefractive surgical techniques still have some distinct disadvantages due to inadequate reparative wound healing.

1546,21645374,"Programmed cell death (PCD) is the regulated death of cells within an organism. The lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis) produces perforations in its leaves through PCD. The leaves of the plant consist of a latticework of longitudinal and transverse veins enclosing areoles. PCD occurs in the cells at the center of these areoles and progresses outwards, stopping approximately five cells from the vasculature. The role of mitochondria during PCD has been recognized in animals; however, it has been less studied during PCD in plants.
The following paper elucidates the role of mitochondrial dynamics during developmentally regulated PCD in vivo in A. madagascariensis. A single areole within a window stage leaf (PCD is occurring) was divided into three areas based on the progression of PCD; cells that will not undergo PCD (NPCD), cells in early stages of PCD (EPCD), and cells in late stages of PCD (LPCD). Window stage leaves were stained with the mitochondrial dye MitoTracker Red CMXRos and examined. Mitochondrial dynamics were delineated into four categories (M1-M4) based on characteristics including distribution, motility, and membrane potential (Î”Î¨m). A TUNEL assay showed fragmented nDNA in a gradient over these mitochondrial stages. Chloroplasts and transvacuolar strands were also examined using live cell imaging. The possible importance of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) formation during PCD was indirectly examined via in vivo cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment. This treatment resulted in lace plant leaves with a significantly lower number of perforations compared to controls, and that displayed mitochondrial dynamics similar to that of non-PCD cells.",Do mitochondria play a role in remodelling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death?,"Yes.

1553,8262881,"Although body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is classified in DSM-III-R as a nonpsychotic somatoform disorder, controversy exists as to whether BDD can present with psychotic features. If it can, this raises the possibility that its DSM-III-R psychotic counterpart-delusional disorder, somatic type--may not be a separate disorder. The purpose of this study was to determine whether patients with nonpsychotic BDD (defined according to DSM-III-R criteria, i.e., with maintenance of some insight) were different from patients with psychotic BDD (those whose preoccupation was without insight and of delusional intensity).
Fifty consecutive patients meeting DSM-III-R criteria A and C for BDD were assessed with a semistructured interview and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R (SCID). Family histories of psychiatric disorders were blindly assessed. The 24 patients with nonpsychotic BDD were compared with the 26 patients with psychotic BDD with respect to demographics, phenomenology, course of illness, associated features, comorbid psychiatric disorders, family history, and treatment response.
Patients with psychotic BDD displayed a significantly higher rate of lifetime DSM-III-R psychotic disorder diagnoses than patients with nonpsychotic BDD. However, the two groups did not differ significantly on most other variables examined. For instance, both psychotic and nonpsychotic patients displayed significant morbidity; high comorbidity with mood, anxiety, and psychoactive substance use disorders; and apparent preferential response to serotonin reuptake inhibitors rather than to non-serotonin reuptake blocking antidepressants or antipsychotics.",Body dysmorphic disorder: does it have a psychotic subtype?,"Yes.

Conventional screening criteria are too limiting and exclude suitable heart donors. Echocardiography is now widely available and is a reliable tool to assess left ventricular dysfunction in brain-dead donors. Yet few data are available on the degree of left ventricular dysfunction where a transplantation is possible.
Fifty-five potential brain-dead heart donors (age 38 +/- 11 years) were prospectively evaluated by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) before harvesting. Fractional area change (FAC) was used to assess left ventricular function in potential brain-dead donors. Transplanted hearts were evaluated on the fifth postoperative day. The transplantation was considered a success if the recipient was alive, not retransplanted, without an assistance device or an epinephrine infusion of more than 1 mg/h and showed an ejection fraction above 40%.
Of the 55 potential heart donors, 20 exhibited an FAC of less than 50%. Forty hearts were harvested, 36 of which were successfully transplanted. Nine patients had an FAC below 50% (group H2) and 27 had an FAC over 50% (group H1). Four patients died: 2 from hemorrhage (FAC>50% in donors); 1 from right and one from left ventricular dysfunction (FAC<50% in donors).

The concept of SLT results from the development of reduced-size transplantation. A further development of SLT, the in situ split technique, is derived from LRT, which itself marks the optimized outcome in terms of postoperative graft function and survival. The combination of SLT and LRT has abolished deaths on the waiting list, thus raising the question whether living donor liver transplantation is still necessary.
Outcomes and postoperative liver function of 43 primary LRT patients were compared with those of 49 primary SLT patients (14 ex situ, 35 in situ) with known graft weight performed between April 1996 and December 2000. Survival rates were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method.
After a median follow-up of 35 months, actual patient survival rates were 82% in the SLT group and 88% in the LRT group. Actual graft survival rates were 76% and 81%, respectively. The incidence of primary nonfunction was 12% in the SLT group and 2.3% in the LRT group. Liver function parameters (prothrombin time, factor V, bilirubin clearance) and surgical complication rates did not differ significantly.

In order for meaningful results to be extrapolated to specific populations, the limitations of the data and linkage methodology need to be investigated and clarified. It is the objective of this study to investigate the differences in ascertainment which may arise between a hospital admission dataset and a dispensing claims dataset, using major depression in pregnancy as an example. The safe use of antidepressants in pregnancy is an ongoing issue for clinicians with around 10% of pregnant women suffer from depression. As the birth admission will be the first admission to hospital during their pregnancy for most women, their use of antidepressants, or their depressive condition, may not be revealed to the attending hospital clinicians. This may result in adverse outcomes for the mother and infant.

The women with depression during their pregnancy were ascertained in two ways: women with dispensing records relating to dispensed antidepressant medicines with an WHO ATC code to the 3rd level, pharmacological subgroup, 'N06A Antidepressants'; and, women with any hospital admission during pregnancy, including the birth admission, if a comorbidity was recorded relating to depression.
From 2002 to 2005, there were 96698 births in WA. At least one antidepressant was dispensed to 4485 (4.6%) pregnant women. There were 3010 (3.1%) women with a comorbidity related to depression recorded on their delivery admission, or other admission to hospital during pregnancy. There were a total of 7495 pregnancies identified by either set of records. Using data linkage, we determined that these records represented 6596 individual pregnancies. Only 899 pregnancies were found in both groups (13.6% of all cases). 80% of women dispensed an antidepressant did not have depression recorded as a comorbidity on their hospital records. A simple capture-recapture calculation suggests the prevalence of depression in this population of pregnant women to be around 16%.",Are women with major depression in pregnancy identifiable in population health data?,"Yes.

Therefore, BMR prediction equations have been developed in multiple populations because indirect calorimetry is not always feasible. However, there is a paucity of data on BMR measured in overweight and obese adults living in Asia and equations developed for this group of interest. The aim of this study was to develop a new BMR prediction equation for Chinese adults applicable for a large BMI range and compare it with commonly used prediction equations.
Subjects were 121 men and 111 women (age: 21-67 years, BMI: 16-41Â kg/m(2)). Height, weight, and BMR were measured. Continuous open-circuit indirect calorimetry using a ventilated hood system for 30Â min was used to measure BMR. A regression equation was derived using stepwise regression and accuracy was compared to 6 existing equations (Harris-Benedict, Henry, Liu, Yang, Owen and Mifflin). Additionally, the newly derived equation was cross-validated in a separate group of 70 Chinese subjects (26 men and 44 women, age: 21-69 years, BMI: 17-39Â kg/m(2)).

Patients with SCD presenting to the emergency department and hematology clinic with temperature greater than or equal to 38 degrees C were prospectively evaluated using a physician-completed questionnaire. The questionnaire included inquiries into the patient's physical signs and symptoms and the physician's clinical impression for the presence of ACS. The questionnaire was completed before obtaining CXR results in all patients.
Seventy-three patients with SCD with 96 febrile events were evaluated over a 1-year period. Twenty-four percent (23/96) of the patients had CXR evidence of ACS. On the basis of the questionnaire data, 61% (14/23) of ACS cases were not clinically suspected by the evaluating physician before obtaining CXR. Comparing the patients with and without ACS revealed that, with the exception of splinting (4/23 [17%] versus 0/73 [0%]), no symptom or physical examination finding helped to identify which patients had ACS. Fifty-seven percent of patients with ACS had completely normal findings on physical examination. The presentation of patients with clinically detected versus clinically unsuspected ACS also did not differ significantly.

Total prenatal MAO inhibition produced a pervasive increase in aggressive behavior, whereas MAO-B inhibited mice demonstrated a similar pattern of lower intensity. Aggression was elevated in MAO-A inhibited mice only after acute pharmacologic challenge, suggesting prenatal sensitization.",Does monoamine oxidase inhibition during brain development induce pathological aggressive behavior in mice?,"No. Developmental inhibition of MAO activity does not engender behavioral effects that parallel those observed in animals with genetic ablation of MAO function. These data underscore the importance of neurochemical changes during development but do not provide a possible model for disinhibited aggression, common in clinical populations.",FAIL,pubmedQA," Yes, monoamine oxidase inhibition during brain development can induce pathological aggressive behavior in mice.","in redox reactions, causing the production of ROS, and thus leading to oxidative stress [7] .

1611,21988540,"Experimental and clinical studies have suggested that inhibitors of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) might be useful to slow the progression of valvular calcification in patients with aortic stenosis (AS).
The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationships between the weight and tissue remodelling score of stenotic aortic valves explanted at the time of valve replacement surgery and to determine the effect of medications including angiotensin II receptor type I blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on these variables.
Aortic valve and blood plasma were collected in 208 patients with AS (mean age: 69 Â± 9) who underwent aortic valve replacement. Valves were weighed and the degree of valve tissue remodelling was assessed using a modified scoring system from Warren (Score: 1-4).

The study included 53 highly myopic eyes in 34 patients with a history of ROP, and 66 highly myopic eyes in 37 full-term patients. Measurements included refraction, keratometry, and A-scan values for axial length, lens thickness, lens position, anterior chamber depth, anterior segment depth, and lens power calculations. Comparisons were also made with published age-matched, full-term normal controls.
Refractions ranged from a spherical-equivalent of -5.0 to -20.75, and from -5.0 to -22.0 diopters in ROP and full-term eyes, respectively. For ROP eyes, increasing myopia was most associated with lens thickness and lens power ( P < 0.001), with lesser contributions from corneal steepness, axial length, and a more forward position of the lens's center. For the eyes with myopia in full-term patients, increasing myopia was highly associated with axial length ( P < 0.001), with smaller contributions from increased lens thickness and lens power. ROP eyes had a lens-thickness/anterior-chamber-depth ratio almost 50% higher than FT and normative eyes. Anterior segment depth was remarkably similar in all eyes studied.",Is high myopia associated with retinopathy of prematurity primarily lenticular?,"Yes. High myopia associated with ROP appears pathophysiologically distinct from high myopia in full-term patients.

1613,15343225,"Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is an important reason for premature delivery and has been reported to be associated with increased mortality, but in some studies paradoxically, improved morbidities. Data on neonatal outcomes for infants with IUGR at each viable gestational age at birth from large numbers of deliveries are lacking. More particularly, data on perinatal outcome related to an antenatal diagnosis of IUGR compared with a neonatal diagnosis are particularly deficient. Therefore, by using a large contemporary database, we evaluated the outcomes of neonates with IUGR and the gestational age-specific associations between growth restriction, morbidity, and mortality.
With the use of a database formed from a computer-assisted tool that generates clinical progress notes and discharge summaries on neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admissions, we reviewed data on neonates discharged from 124 NICUs between January 1, 1997, and December 31, 2001. We evaluated singleton, inborn neonates who delivered between 23 and 34 weeks, excluding major congenital anomalies. We compared 3 measures of IUGR: antenatally diagnosed IUGR; a birth weight below the 10th percentile (small for gestational age [SGA]), and newborn infants with either or both of these diagnoses against a control group of gestational age-matched infants meeting none of these criteria whose birth weights were no greater than the 90th percentile.
Our sample included 29,916 prematurely born neonates; 1,451 (4.8%) with IUGR, 2,936 (9.8%) who were SGA, and 3,708 (12.3%) had at least 1 of these 2 markers. There were 22,798 (76%) normally grown control neonates. Within each gestational age group from 25 to 32 weeks, each marker of IUGR was associated with increased mortality, necrotizing enterocolitis, need for respiratory support at 28 days of age, and retinopathy of the premature. When corrected for gestational age, exposure to antenatal steroids, gender, and mode of delivery, these associations remained significant.",Does intrauterine growth restriction increase morbidity and mortality among premature neonates?,"No. IUGR does not significantly increase morbidity and mortality among prematurely born neonates, regardless of the definition used or whether the diagnosis is made antenatally or after birth.

Here we examine their effects upon TNFalpha release from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages and investigate a potential mechanism of action through effects on LPS-stimulated nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation.
Peripheral venous blood was drawn from the antecubital fossa of human volunteers. Mononuclear cells were isolated and cultured. The resultant differentiated macrophages were treated with pharmacologically relevant concentrations of either a furoxan-aspirin (B8, B7; 10 muM), their respective furazan NO-free counterparts (B16, B15; 10 muM), aspirin (10 muM), existing nitroaspirin (NCX4016; 10 muM), an NO donor (DEA/NO; 10 muM) or dexamethasone (1 muM), in the presence and absence of LPS (10 ng/ml; 4 h).

1624,18082462,"Elucidation of the factors responsible for symptomatic failure of spinal instrumentation has been a keen interest for many investigators.
To quantitate the number of symptomatic instrumentation failures (SIFs) encountered during a 2-year period. The effect of sagittal plane imbalance (corrected or uncorrected) on the rate of SIF was evaluated.
Retrospective evaluation of all patients requiring spinal instrumentation to determine which factors predispose toward instrumentation failure.
All patients requiring spinal instrumentation over a 2-year period were retrospectively studied.
Sagittal plane imbalance pre- and postoperatively was determined using Cobb angle analysis on plain X-rays. SIF was defined as screw back-out and/or breakage, pseudarthrosis, cage migration, or rod disconnection in patients with concordant symptoms. Asymptomatic patients did not demonstrate instrumentation failure on the routine postoperative X-rays.
Of the 355 patients who fit the criteria, 47 patients presented with either idiopathic or secondary sagittal plane deformity preoperatively. Additionally, long-segment fixation, smoking, age, and fixation across junctional segments were evaluated as risk factors for SIF.
Of the 47 patients with sagittal plane deformity, 40 patients (85%) achieved correction demonstrated on postoperative radiographs whereas in 7 (15%), the sagittal plane imbalance was not corrected. Of these seven cases, five suffered instrumentation failure (failure rate 71.5%) versus no instrumentation failures (failure rate 0%) for the remaining 40 patients.

1631,25255917,"NOD2 is the genetic cause of Blau syndrome, an autoinflammatory disease that manifests as coincident uveitis and arthritis. Since dysregulation of IL-1 signalling is considered a pathogenic mechanism in a number of related autoinflammatory conditions, we examined the extent to which unimpeded interleukin (IL)-1 signalling influences NOD2-dependent inflammation of the eye versus the joint.
Mice deficient for IL-1R antagonist (IL-1Ra) were administered the NOD2 agonist muramyl dipeptide (MDP) by systemic (intraperitoneal) or local (intraocular and/or intra-articular) injections. NOD2-deficient mice received an intraocular injection of recombinant IL-1Î². Uveitis was evaluated by intravital videomicroscopy and histopathology, and arthritis was assessed by near-infrared imaging and histopathology. Ocular levels of IL-1Î±, IL-1Î² and IL-1Ra were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
IL-1Ra deficiency did not render mice more responsive to systemic exposure of MDP. Despite the increased production of IL-1R agonists IL-1Î± and IL-1Î² in response to intraocular injection of MDP, deficiency in IL-1Ra did not predispose mice to MDP-triggered uveitis, albeit intravascular cell rolling and adherence were exacerbated. NOD2 expression was dispensable for the potential of IL-1 to elicit uveitis.

Abstract: nan"
1638,20421986,"Hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons receive two excitatory glutamatergic synaptic inputs: their most distal dendritic regions in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare (SLM) are innervated by the perforant path (PP), originating from layer III of the entorhinal cortex, while their more proximal regions of the apical dendrites in the stratum radiatum (SR) are innervated by the Schaffer-collaterals (SC), originating from hippocampal CA3 neurons. Endocannabinoids (eCBs) are naturally occurring mediators capable of modulating both GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptic transmission and plasticity via the CB1 receptor. Previous work on eCB modulation of excitatory synapses in the CA1 region largely focuses on the SC pathway. However, little information is available on whether and how eCBs modulate glutamatergic synaptic transmission and plasticity at PP synapses.
By employing somatic and dendritic patch-clamp recordings, Ca(2+) uncaging, and immunostaining, we demonstrate that there are significant differences in low-frequency stimulation (LFS)- or DHPG-, an agonist of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), induced long-term depression (LTD) of excitatory synaptic transmission between SC and PP synapses in the same pyramidal neurons. These differences are eliminated by pharmacological inhibition with selective CB1 receptor antagonists or genetic deletion of the CB1 receptor, indicating that these differences likely result from differential modulation via a CB1 receptor-dependent mechanism. We also revealed that depolarization-induced suppression of excitation (DSE), a form of short-term synaptic plasticity, and photolysis of caged Ca(2+)-induced suppression of Excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were less at the PP than that at the SC. In addition, application of WIN55212 (WIN) induced a more pronounced inhibition of EPSCs at the SC when compared to that at the PP.",Do endocannabinoids differentially modulate synaptic plasticity in rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons?,"Yes.

In our study, we determined the effect of GANT61-mediated inhibition of GLI in Daoy MB cells. Cells were treated with different concentrations of GANT61 alone or in combination with cisplatin. Cell proliferation was assessed with CCK-8 assays, and cell invasion and migration were performed using 8-Âµm transwell inserts.

1643,14684582,"The mucosa in ulcerative colitis (UC) is replete with antibody producing plasma B cells and polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMN). This combination of effector cells requires a crosslinking antigen to evoke an antibody driven PMN inflammatory response via their Fc receptors. The stimulus for activation is thought to be commensal bacteria colonising the gut mucosa. The aim of this investigation was to compare the principal culturable bacterial populations on the rectal mucosa of UC patients, and to determine whether specific antibodies towards these bacteria can activate infiltrating PMN through opsonisation. This would provide an explanation for this chronic inflammatory condition.
Bacteria colonising rectal tissue were characterised using chemotaxonomic techniques. Systemic antibody responses were measured against total antigens and surface antigens of these organisms in UC and Crohn's disease (CD) patients, together with healthy controls. Antibody enhancement of the respiratory burst in PMN was also investigated, against a range of mucosal isolates.
Distinct differences were observed in some bacterial populations in UC biopsies, which were generally reflected in antibody responses towards these organisms. UC patients had higher IgG responses to surface antigens, primarily IgG1, whereas the response in CD was mainly IgG2.

Although fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) signaling is important for cell proliferation and differentiation in various tissues, its role in intestinal differentiation is less well understood.
We used a loss of function approach to investigate the importance of Fgf signaling in intestinal cell differentiation in zebrafish; abnormal differentiation of goblet cells was observed when Fgf signaling was inhibited using SU5402 or in the Tg(hsp70ldnfgfr1-EGFP) transgenic line. We identified Fgfr2c as an important receptor for cell differentiation. The number of goblet cells and enteroendocrine cells was reduced in fgfr2c morphants.

1652,11319879,"In addition to aiding in the digestion of fats, luminal bile salts have been shown to modulate gastrointestinal epithelial growth, differentiation, and other functions. We hypothesized that bile acids could modulate the intestinal mucosal repair process of restitution. We investigated the effect of the bile salt taurodeoxycholic acid on epithelial migration and identified a role for TGFbeta, a widely expressed cytokine in the intestinal villus, in this repair process.
Using a well-established model of epithelial restitution, IEC-6 cells were plated on 60-mm Matrigel-coated plastic dishes and grown to confluence. The epithelium was wounded by scraping with a 6-mm-wide blade to create a smooth denuded edge and cell migration was measured 8 h later. Cells were grown in control DMEM with 5% FBS with or without 0.01-2 mM taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA). In parallel experiments, cells were harvested for Northern analysis of TGFbeta and GAPDH expression; [3H]thymidine uptake was used to measure proliferation. Anti-TGFbeta antibody was added to cells grown in the presence of 0.05 mM TDCA and migration was measured at 8 h.
TDCA at physiologic luminal concentrations augments IEC-6 cell migration, with a maximal effect at 0.05 mM. TDCA inhibited proliferation at these concentrations. TGFbeta expression increased in response to bile acid, while wounding had less of an effect on TGFbeta expression. Blockade of TGFbeta function with TGFbeta antibody eliminated the effect of bile on cell migration.",Does bile salt stimulate intestinal epithelial cell migration through TGFbeta after wounding?,Yes. Bile acid at physiologic concentrations augments small intestinal epithelial cell migration. The process is dependent on TGFbeta and is dependent on cell division.

Despite the detailed description of the role of CYP2E1 in the liver, its functions in other tissues have not been extensively studied. In this study, we investigated the functional significance of CYP2E1 in breast carcinogenesis.
Cellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured by H2DCFDA (2 2.9.2 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate) staining and autophagy was assessed by tracing the cellular levels of autophagy markers using western blot assays.

1663,25443020,"Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support is often required in the management of perioperative congenital heart surgery (CHS) patients. However, 24-hour in-hospital congenital cardiac surgical coverage (24-CCSC) is not available at all institutions. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of 24-CCSC on perioperative ECMO outcomes in CHS patients.
An institutional review board approved, retrospective review of 128 perioperative CHS ECMO patients at a single, quaternary care children's hospital between January 2003 and December 2012 was performed. Primary endpoints evaluated were mortality in children supported with ECMO after undergoing cardiac surgery and ECMO-related morbidity after initiation of 24-CCSC with advanced congenital cardiac surgical fellows. Patients were divided into 2 groups based on whether 24-CCSC was absent (cohort 1: January 2003 to July 2007) or present (cohort 2: August 2007 to December 2012) at the time of ECMO management.
The surgical procedures performed were similar in both cohorts based on STAT Mortality Categories (5 Society of Thoracic Surgeons-European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery Congenital Heart Surgery Mortality Categories). The overall mortality rate in children supported with ECMO after undergoing cardiac surgery was 53%. This mortality was significantly reduced from 68% to 43% (pÂ = 0.007) withÂ 24-CCSC. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that 24-CCSC (pÂ = 0.009) and lower STAT Mortality Category (pÂ = 0.042) were independent predictors of operative survival.

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR for mRNA expression and radioimmunoassay for GnRH secretion were used. Immunohistochemical studies assessed GnRH protein expression. FNC-B4 migration was analyzed with multiwell Boyden chamber technique.
Effects of the non-aromatizable androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and leptin in FNC-B4 were tested after 24 and 48 hours.
Exposure to increasing concentrations of DHT after 24 hours significantly stimulated GnRH mRNA in FNC-B4. This effect was still present after prolonged exposure (48 hours). Similarly, treatment with leptin significantly induced GnRH mRNA after 24 hours, but not at 48 hours. Interestingly, mRNA for leptin receptors (LEPR) was significantly reduced after 48 hours of leptin, while, at this time point, it was stimulated by DHT. Coincubation for 48 hours with leptin and DHT maintained the stimulatory effect on both GnRH and LEPR mRNA, suggesting that DHT could stabilize the leptin effect by preventing downregulation of LEPR. Similar results were obtained for GnRH protein expression analysis. Moreover, both DHT and leptin increased GnRH release into the culture medium. We also found that DHT or leptin treatment significantly increased FNC-B4 basal migration.

The data revealed that mRNA from the five genes investigated was detected in all brain regions and showed an overall significant difference in expression levels. Furthermore, the expression of 5-HT2C, 5-HT2A and TPH2 was found to be significantly different between the various brain regions.

We assessed the relationship of CRP levels to specific components of MSX and other potential determinants in apparently healthy elderly subjects living in the South of France.
In the framework of the population-based POLA (Pathologies Oculaires LiÃ©es Ã  l'Age) Study, performed in 2,404 subjects aged 60 years or more, we measured the plasma CRP levels. All subjects with known systemic inflammatory diseases, such as chronic bronchitis, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes, and those who were on systemic steroid therapy as well as subjects with CRP levels >10 mg/l were excluded from the study, leaving 1,709 subjects for the statistical analyses. MSX was defined according to NCEP (National Cholesterol Education Program) criteria. Other potential determinants were assessed through interviewer-based questionnaire.
We grouped the subjects into three categories based on the 75th and 25th percentiles, corresponding to 3.05 and 0.82, respectively. We compared subjects in the highest quartile, i.e., with CRP >/=3.05 mg/l, with those in the two intermediate quartiles, i.e., with 0.82 < CRP < 3.05, and those in the lowest quartile, i.e., with CRP <0.82 mg/l according to gender. MSX, which had a prevalence of 31%, was significantly associated with elevated CRP levels. Among MSX components, the strongest positive association with the highest quartile of CRP was with waist circumference in males as well as in females (age-adjusted odds ratio OR 3.06 and 95% confidence interval CI 1.82-5.14; OR 7.04 and 95% CI 4.79-10.34, respectively).

To identify potential treatments for diabetic encephalopathy, we focused on the protective action of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) against neural cell apoptosis. In this study, we evaluated whether exposure of cells to GLP-1 leads to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) transactivation and signaling through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR/GCLc/redox pathway, which we previously reported.
We monitored the phosphorylation of EGFR and Akt in PC12 cells exposed to MG and GLP-1 that had been first incubated in the presence or absence of various inhibitors of EGFR transactivation.

Multiple genetic loci for osteoporotic fracture were identified in recent genome-wide association studies. The purpose of this study was to identify genetic variants associated with the occurrence of hip fracture in Japanese patients with RA.
DNA samples from 2,282 Japanese patients with RA were obtained from the DNA collection of the Institute of Rheumatology Rheumatoid Arthritis cohort (IORRA) study. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that have been reported to be associated with fractures in recent studies were selected and genotyped. Forty hip fractures were identified with a maximum follow-up of 10 years. The genetic risk for hip fracture was examined using a multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model.
The risk analyses revealed that patients who are homozygous for the major allele of SNP rs6993813, in the OPG locus, have a higher risk for hip fracture (hazard ratio [95% CI] = 2.53 [1.29-4.95], P = 0.0067).

1688,16524483,"Retinal photoreceptors are highly specialised cells, which detect light and are central to mammalian vision. Many retinal diseases occur as a result of inherited dysfunction of the rod and cone photoreceptor cells. Development and maintenance of photoreceptors requires appropriate regulation of the many genes specifically or highly expressed in these cells. Over the last decades, different experimental approaches have been developed to identify photoreceptor enriched genes. Recent progress in RNA analysis technology has generated large amounts of gene expression data relevant to retinal development. This paper assesses a machine learning methodology for supporting the identification of photoreceptor enriched genes based on expression data.
Based on the analysis of publicly-available gene expression data from the developing mouse retina generated by serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE), this paper presents a predictive methodology comprising several in silico models for detecting key complex features and relationships encoded in the data, which may be useful to distinguish genes in terms of their functional roles. In order to understand temporal patterns of photoreceptor gene expression during retinal development, a two-way cluster analysis was firstly performed. By clustering SAGE libraries, a hierarchical tree reflecting relationships between developmental stages was obtained. By clustering SAGE tags, a more comprehensive expression profile for photoreceptor cells was revealed. To demonstrate the usefulness of machine learning-based models in predicting functional associations from the SAGE data, three supervised classification models were compared. The results indicated that a relatively simple instance-based model (KStar model) performed significantly better than relatively more complex algorithms, e.g. neural networks. To deal with the problem of functional class imbalance occurring in the dataset, two data re-sampling techniques were studied. A random over-sampling method supported the implementation of the most powerful prediction models. The KStar model was also able to achieve higher predictive sensitivities and specificities using random over-sampling techniques.",Does machine learning approach to supporting the identification of photoreceptor-enriched genes based on expression data?,"Yes. The approaches assessed in this paper represent an efficient and relatively inexpensive in silico methodology for supporting large-scale analysis of photoreceptor gene expression by SAGE. They may be applied as complementary methodologies to support functional predictions before implementing more comprehensive, experimental prediction and validation methods. They may also be combined with other large-scale, data-driven methods to facilitate the inference of transcriptional regulatory networks in the mature retina.

In a crossover design, eight adult female common marmosets (Calithrix jacchus) received daily flibanserin or vehicle. After 7-12 weeks of treatment, the glucose metabolism radiotracer [(18) F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) was administered to each female immediately prior to 30 minutes of interaction with her male pairmate, after which females were anesthetized and imaged by positron emission tomography. Whole-brain normalized images were analyzed with anatomically defined regions of interest. Whole-brain voxelwise mapping was used to explore treatment effects. Correlations were examined between alterations in metabolism and pairmate social grooming.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical role of lymphangiogenesis and LVI in a large cohort of esophageal cancer.
For the specific assessment of LMVD and LVI, 393 tissue samples from a prospective tissue databank of esophageal adenocarcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas, and their precursor lesions were included into this study. LMVD and LVI were assessed by immunostaining for podoplanin, a selective marker of lymphatic endothelium. In addition the peritumoral inflammatory stroma reaction (ISR) was assessed.

In the present study, we addressed whether estrogen could activate vasculoprotective mechanisms via annexin A1 (AnxA1) mobilization in human polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs).
Using whole-blood flow cytometry, we demonstrated that premenopausal women expressed higher levels of surface AnxA1 on circulating PMNs compared with males. This correlated with high plasma estrogen during the menstrual cycle. The addition of estrogen in vitro to male PMNs induced rapid mobilization of AnxA1, optimal at 5 ng/mL and a 30-minute incubation period; this effect was abolished in the presence of the estrogen receptor antagonist ICI182780. Estrogen addition to human PMNs induced a distinct AnxA1(hi) CD62L(lo) CD11b(lo) phenotype, and this was associated with lower cell activation as measured by microparticle formation.

We previously demonstrated that cyclosporine A treatment during resuscitation can significantly improve cardiovascular performance in asphyxiated newborn piglets. However, the mechanisms through which cyclosporine elicits its protective effect in neonates have not yet been fully characterized. We hypothesized that cyclosporine A treatment would attenuate myocardial and cardiac mitochondrial injury during the resuscitation of asphyxiated newborn piglets.
After acute instrumentation, piglets received normocapnic alveolar hypoxia (10% to 15% oxygen) for 2 hours followed by reoxygenation with 100% oxygen (0.5 hr) and then 21% oxygen (3.5 hr). At 4 hours of reoxygenation, plasma troponin level, left ventricle myocardial levels of lipid hydroperoxides, cytochrome-c, and mitochondrial aconitase activity were determined.

To define carbohydrate absorption characteristics in patients with short bowel syndrome and determine the potential role of pectin as a dietary substrate.
The authors studied the effect of a custom pectin-based supplement in 6 subjects (3 male/3 female) aged 29-67 years with jejunocolonic anastomosis, 4 of whom required long-term parental nutrition. Small intestinal absorption capacity, macronutrient and fluid balance, gastrointestinal transit time, and energy consumption were measured.
Data showed that 53% nitrogen, 50% fat, and 32% total energy were malabsorbed. In contrast, the majority (92%) of total carbohydrate was utilized. Fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were increased, an indication of increased fermentation. Although only 4% of starch was recovered in stool, it is indicative of considerable starch malabsorption, thus providing the main carbohydrate substrate, for colonic bacterial fermentation. In contrast, nonstarch polysaccharide was a relatively minor fermentation substrate with only 49% utilized. Eighty percent of the pectin was fermented. Supplementation was associated with increased total SCFAs, acetate, and propionate excretion. There was a trend observed toward greater fluid absorption (-5.9% Â± 54.4% to 26.9% Â± 25.2%) following pectin supplementation. Nonsignificant increases in gastric emptying time and orocolonic transit time were observed.","Is macronutrient absorption characteristics in humans with short bowel syndrome and jejunocolonic anastomosis : starch the most important carbohydrate substrate , although pectin supplementation may modestly enhance short chain fatty acid production and fluid absorption?","Yes.

This situation has several health implications, one being that mutations that confer resistance to CQ have been reported to show substantial cross-resistance to other anti-malarial drugs. It is important to identify some of the factors contributing to the continuous presence of CQ resistance markers in the country. This study determined the prevalence of T76 mutation in pfcrt gene of Plasmodium falciparum isolates collected from selected areas of the Central region of Ghana and correlated with the level of CQ use in these areas.
Plasmodium falciparum DNA was extracted from collected blood-blot filter paper samples in the study sites. The prevalence of T76 point mutation in pfcrt gene was assessed using nested PCR followed by RFLP. CQ from pharmacy and chemical shops was obtained using mystery buying method.

A catheter was inserted in the distal part of the splenic vein of the pancreas graft. After reperfusion blood samples were taken from this catheter and blood flow was measured by the venous outflow method. The degree of graft pancreatitis was assessed by peak-C-reactive protein (CRP) defined as highest CRP within 3 days after transplantation.
Tissue pO2 increased within 5 min after reperfusion. Thereafter, in most patients a transient decrease was noted, indicating impairment of nutritive perfusion. During this period there was an increasing negative correlation between peak-CRP and tissue pO2 which was highly significant at 60 min after reperfusion (r=-0.70, P<0.002).

These data highlight the mandatory role of F-actin in platelet biogenesis.,Do cdc42-dependent F-actin dynamics drive structuration of the demarcation membrane system in megakaryocytes?,"No. Background Blood platelet biogenesis results from the maturation of megakaryocytes (MKs), which involves the development of a complex demarcation membrane system (DMS). Therefore, MK differentiation is an attractive model for studying membrane remodeling. Objectives We sought to investigate the mechanism of DMS structuration in relationship to the cytoskeleton. Results Using three-dimensional (3D) confocal imaging, we have identified consecutive stages of DMS organization that rely on microtubule dynamics to polarize membranes and nuclei territories. Interestingly, F-actin is not involved in this process. We found that the mechanism underlying microtubule-dependent DMS formation required the activation of the guanosine triphosphate hydrolase Cdc42 and its p21-activated kinase effectors (Pak1/2/3). FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer demonstrated that active Cdc42 was associated with endomembrane dynamics throughout terminal maturation. Inhibition of Cdc42 or Pak1/2/3 severely destructured the DMS and blocked proplatelet formation. Even though this process does not require containment within the hematopoietic niche, because DMS structuration was observed upon thrombopoietin-treatment in suspension, integrin outside-in signaling was required for Pak activation and probably resulted from secretion of extracellular matrix by MKs. Conclusions These data indicate a functional link, mandatory for MK differentiation, between microtubule dynamics, regulated by Cdc42/Pak1/2/3, and DMS maturation.",FAIL,pubmedQA, I don't have information to confirm or deny if cdc42-dependent F-actin dynamics drive structuration of the demarcation membrane system in megakaryocytes.,"MKP-1 acts as a negative regulator in LPS-induced signaling pathways [7] .

Recovery of sensorimotor function following stroke can vary widely, from complete recovery to modest or minimal improvements, across individuals. An important question is whether one can predict the amount of recovery based on initial examination of the individual. Robotic technologies are now being used to quantify a range of behavioral capabilities of individuals post-stroke, providing a rich set of biomarkers of sensory and motor dysfunction. The objective of the present study is to use mathematical models to identify which biomarkers best predict the ability of subjects with stroke to perform daily activities before and after rehabilitation.

Antineuroinflammatory strategies have identified the dietary-derived epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) as an efficient agent to prevent neuroinflammation-associated neurodegenerative diseases by targeting proinflammatory mediator signaling.
Given that high levels of sphingosine kinase and its product, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), are present in brain tumors, we used quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunoblotting to test whether EGCG may impact on S1P receptor gene expression and prevent S1P response in undifferentiated and in terminally differentiated macrophages.
Promyelomonocytic human leukemia (HL)-60 cells were differentiated into macrophages, and S1P triggered phosphorylation in extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) intracellular signaling, as shown by Western blot analysis. Pretreatment of cells with EGCG prior to differentiation inhibited the response to S1P in all three pathways, while EGCG abrogated P38 MAPK phosphorylation when present only during differentiation. Terminally-differentiated macrophages were, however, insensitive to EGCG treatment.

1797,22691188,"The finite replicative lifespan of cells, termed cellular senescence, has been proposed as a protective mechanism against the proliferation of oncogenically damaged cells, that fuel cancer. This concept is further supported by the induction of premature senescence, a process which is activated when an oncogene is expressed in normal primary cells as well as following intense genotoxic stresses. Thus, deregulation of genes that control this process, like the tumor suppressor p53, may contribute to promoting cancer by allowing cells to bypass senescence. A better understanding of the genes that contribute to the establishment of senescence is therefore warranted. Necdin interacts with p53 and is also a p53 target gene, although the importance of Necdin in the p53 response is not clearly understood.

Gain and loss of function experiments were used to evaluate the contribution of Necdin during the senescence process.
Necdin expression declined during replicative aging of IMR90 primary human fibroblasts or following induction of premature senescence. Decrease in Necdin expression seemed to be a consequence of the establishment of senescence since the depletion of Necdin in human cells did not induce a senescence-like growth arrest nor a flat morphology or SA-Î²-galactosidase activity normally associated with senescence.

1800,18258429,"The maintenance of the body's Mg(2+) balance is of great importance because of its involvement in numerous enzymatic systems and its intervention in neuromuscular excitability, protein synthesis, and nucleic acid stability. Recently, the transient receptor potential melastatin 6 (TRPM6) was identified as the gatekeeper of active Mg(2+) transport and therefore plays a crucial role in the regulation of Mg(2+) homeostasis. Remarkably, TRPM6 combines a Mg(2+) channel with an alpha-kinase domain whose function remains elusive.
Here, we identify the receptor for activated C-kinase 1 (RACK1) as the first regulatory protein of TRPM6 that associates with the alpha-kinase domain. RACK1 and TRPM6 are both present in renal Mg(2+)-transporting distal convoluted tubules. We demonstrate that RACK1 inhibits channel activity in an alpha-kinase activity-dependent manner, whereas small interference (si) RNA-mediated knockdown of RACK1 increases the current. Moreover, threonine(1851) in the alpha-kinase domain was identified as an autophosphorylation site of which the phosphorylation state is essential for the inhibitory effect of RACK1. Importantly, threonine(1851) was crucial for the Mg(2+) sensitivity of TRPM6 autophosphorylation and channel activity. TRPM6 channel activity was less sensitive to Mg(2+) when RACK1 was knocked down by siRNA.

We investigated whether exposure of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to hypoxia and/or reoxygenation activates complement and decreases HUVEC-surface expression of the C3 regulatory proteins CD46 and CD55.

The LDL, VLDL, and HDL were treated with HL, CE, and Lp-PLA2 after immobilization on plates, and complement activation studies were performed with diluted human serum.

Enzymatic properties of HL and CE were assayed with triglyceride and phosphatidylcholine substrates for triglyceride hydrolase and phospholipase A activities. The ARPE-19 cells were used for viability studies.

The HL degradation of human lipoproteins LDL, VLDL, or HDL results in the formation of modified lipoproteins that can activate the complement pathway.

The VMH contains a high density of neurons that express brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a potent neurodevelopmental effector known to regulate neuronal survival, growth, differentiation, and connectivity in a number of neural systems. In the current study, we examined whether BDNF impacts the afferent and efferent connections of the VMH, as well as energy homeostatic function.
To determine if BDNF is required for VMH circuit formation, a transgenic mouse model was used to conditionally delete Bdnf from steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1) expressing neurons of the VMH prior to the onset of establishing neural connections with other regions. Projections of SF1 expressing neurons were visualized with a genetically targeted fluorescent label and immunofluorescence was used to measure the density of afferents to SF1 neurons in the absence of BDNF. Physiological changes in body weight and circulating blood glucose were also evaluated in the mutant mice.

This cycle is tightly regulated by GEFs (guanine nucleotide-exchange factors) and GAPs (GTPase-activating proteins). Mouse CdGAP (mCdc42 GTPase-activating protein) has been previously identified and characterized as a specific GAP for Rac1 and Cdc42, but not for RhoA. It consists of an N-terminal RhoGAP domain and a C-terminal proline-rich region. In addition, CdGAP-related genes are present in both vertebrates and invertebrates. We have recently reported that two predominant isoforms of CdGAP (250 and 90 kDa) exist in specific mouse tissues.
In the present study, we have identified and characterized human CdGAP (KIAA1204) which shares 76% sequence identity to the long isoform of mCdGAP (mCdGAP-l). Similar to mCdGAP, it is active in vitro and in vivo on both Cdc42 and Rac1, but not RhoA, and is phosphorylated in vivo on serine and threonine residues. In contrast with mCdGAP-l, human CdGAP interacts with ERK1/2 (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2) through a region that does not involve a DEF (docking site for ERK Phe-Xaa-Phe-Pro) domain. Also, the tissue distribution of CdGAP proteins appears to be different between human and mouse species. Interestingly, we found that CdGAP proteins cause membrane blebbing in COS-7 cells.",Is the human orthologue of CdGAP a phosphoprotein and a GTPase-activating protein for Cdc42 and Rac1 but not RhoA?,"Yes.

Multidimensional genomic profiling was performed in human aortic valves to document the expression of lncRNAs and the DNA methylation pattern in calcific aortic valve disease. In-depth functional assays were carried out to document the impact of lncRNA on the mineralization of the aortic valve.
We documented that lncRNA H19 (H19) was increased in calcific aortic valve disease. Hypomethylation of the promoter region was observed in mineralized aortic valves and was inversely associated with H19 expression. Knockdown and overexpression experiments showed that H19 induces a strong osteogenic phenotype by altering the NOTCH1 pathway.

Our aim was to evaluate the ability of the Work Instability Scale for Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA-WIS) to predict arthritis-related work transitions within a 12-month period.
Workers with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis (n = 250) from 3 clinical sites participated in self-administered surveys that assessed the impact of health on employment at multiple time points over 12 months. Multivariable logistic regressions were conducted to assess the ability of the RA-WIS (range 0-23, where 23 = highest work instability) to predict 4 types of work transition: reductions in work hours, disability leaves of absence, changes in job/occupation, or temporary unemployment, assembled as a composite outcome. Covariates assessed include age, sex, education, marital status, income, pain intensity, disease duration, and the Health Assessment Questionnaire. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCCs) were also assessed to further examine the predictive ability of the RA-WIS and to determine optimal cut points for predicting specific work transitions.
After 12 months, 21.7% (n = 50 of 230) of the participants had indicated at least one arthritis-related work transition. Higher baseline RA-WIS was predictive of such an outcome (relative risk [RR] 1.05 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.00-1.11]), particularly at >17 (RR 2.30 [95% CI 1.11-4.77]).

We hypothesized that LBV patients would have a faster cognitive decline and shorter survival compared with patients with pure AD.
Prior reports have shown extrapyramidal signs to be associated with a poorer prognosis in AD. It has been suggested that LBV is often characterized by a rapidly progressive course. Few data are available regarding the rate of cognitive decline in autopsy-confirmed LBV dementia cases.
We searched the databases of the University of California-San Diego Alzheimer's Disease Research Center and the Consortium to Establish a Registry in Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) for dementia cases with 1) an autopsy diagnosis of definite or probable AD (CERAD criteria) with concomitant Lewy bodies and 2) longitudinal MMSE assessments. This resulted in a series of 40 LBV cases and 148 AD cases without Lewy bodies, with comparable baseline MMSE scores, age, and education. The rate of cognitive decline was calculated as the baseline MMSE -- final MMSE. Methods were devised to reduce floor effects on the MMSE.
The average rate of cognitive decline was -5.8 +/- 4.5 points/y in LBV and -4.1 +/- 3.0 points/y in AD (t-test, p < 0.01). The LBV group declined a similar amount on the MMSE (means, -10.0 versus -9.6 points) over a significantly shorter time interval (1.9 versus 2.7 years; p = 0.005) than did AD patients. At baseline, the mean MMSE scores were nearly identical (18.2 in LBV; 17.8 in AD), but on follow-up examinations approximately 1, 2, and 3 years later, there were intergroup mean differences of 1.8 points (two-tailed p = 0.19), 4.2 points (p = 0.04), and 5.6 points (p = 0.03), respectively. The LBV cases had shorter survival time from the onset of cognitive symptoms (7.7 +/- 3.0 years versus 9.3 +/- 3.5 years; p = 0.007) and a shorter mean survival after entry/baseline, which was of marginal significance (3.6 versus 4.1 years; p = 0.11).",Is cognitive decline faster in Lewy body variant than in Alzheimer 's disease?,No. This study demonstrates that LBV is characterized by a slower cognitive decline and decelerated mortality compared with AD.,FAIL,pubmedQA," No, there is no significant difference in the rate of cognitive decline between Lewy Body Variant and Alzheimer's Disease based on the provided study data.","To quantify the rate of cognitive decline on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in autopsy-diagnosed Lewy body variant (LBV) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases.

This episode of early cell death appears to be central to the teratogenic action of hydroxyurea. Several chemicals that are structurally related to hydroxyurea, and that possess a terminal hydroxylamine moiety (-NHOH), also produce limb abnormalities.
To investigate whether the hydroxylamine moiety is responsible for early cell death and, therefore, is likely to be associated with teratogenesis, five structurally related hydroxylamine-bearing chemicals (hydroxylamine hydrochloride, N-methylhydroxylamine hydrochloride, hydroxyurea, acetohydroxamic acid, and hydroxyurethane) were administered at equimolar doses to rabbits either by subcutaneous (8.55 mmol/kg) or intracoelomic (2.66 micromol/embryo) injection on gestational day 12. Five additional chemicals, structurally similar to the hydroxylamine-bearing compounds, but possessing a terminal amino group (-NH(2)) (ammonium hydroxide, methylamine, urea, acetamide, and urethane), were tested at equimolar or higher doses by an identical protocol. In a subsequent experiment, the antioxidant propyl gallate (3.0 mmol/kg or 1.30 micromol/embryo) was co-administered with the hydroxylamine-bearing compounds to determine its effect on early cell death. Embryos were harvested 4 or 8 hr after treatment and analyzed by light microscopy.
Cellular debris was obvious in forelimb buds from embryos treated with the hydroxylamine-bearing compounds; however, none of the amino compounds produced an early episode of embryonic cell death.

Some studies show that HFCS consumption correlates with obesity and insulin resistance, while other studies are in disagreement. Owing to conflicting and insufficient scientific evidence, the safety of HFCS consumption remains controversial.
We investigated the metabolic consequences of mice fed a (a) regular diet, (b) 'Western' high-fat diet or (c) regular diet supplemented with 8% HFCS in drinking water (to mimic soft drinks) for 10 months. Adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) have emerged as a major pathogenic factor for obesity and insulin resistance. ATMs consist of proinflammatory F4/80(+)CD11c(+) macrophages and anti-inflammatory F4/80(+)CD11c(-) macrophages. In this study, we assessed the effects of HFCS on ATMs in intra-abdominal fat.
We found that HFCS feeding in mice induced more severe adipose inflammation and insulin resistance than even the higher-calorie-containing 'Western' high-fat diet, and these HFCS-induced deleterious effects were independent of calorie intake or body fat content. We showed that similar to 'Western' high-fat diet, HFCS triggered a robust increase of both proinflammatory ATMs and anti-inflammatory ATMs in intra-abdominal fat. Remarkably, however, the anti-inflammatory ATMs were much less abundant in HFCS-fed mice than in high-fat-fed mice. Furthermore, we showed that deletion of the ghrelin receptor (growth hormone secretagogue receptor, GHS-R) ameliorates HFCS-induced adipose inflammation and insulin resistance.

1875,23241383,"Lineage specific differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) is largely mediated by specific growth factors and extracellular matrix molecules. Growth factors initiate a cascade of signals which control gene transcription and cell fate specification. There is a lot of interest in inducing hESCs to an endoderm fate which serves as a pathway towards more functional cell types like the pancreatic cells. Research over the past decade has established several robust pathways for deriving endoderm from hESCs, with the capability of further maturation. However, in our experience, the functional maturity of these endoderm derivatives, specifically to pancreatic lineage, largely depends on specific pathway of endoderm induction. Hence it will be of interest to understand the underlying mechanism mediating such induction and how it is translated to further maturation. In this work we analyze the regulatory interactions mediating different pathways of endoderm induction by identifying co-regulated transcription factors.
hESCs were induced towards endoderm using activin A and 4 different growth factors (FGF2 (F), BMP4 (B), PI3KI (P), and WNT3A (W)) and their combinations thereof, resulting in 15 total experimental conditions. At the end of differentiation each condition was analyzed by qRT-PCR for 12 relevant endoderm related transcription factors (TFs). As a first approach, we used hierarchical clustering to identify which growth factor combinations favor up-regulation of different genes. In the next step we identified sets of co-regulated transcription factors using a biclustering algorithm. The high variability of experimental data was addressed by integrating the biclustering formulation with bootstrap re-sampling to identify robust networks of co-regulated transcription factors. Our results show that the transition from early to late endoderm is favored by FGF2 as well as WNT3A treatments under high activin. However, induction of late endoderm markers is relatively favored by WNT3A under high activin.",Does analysis of alternative signaling pathways of endoderm induction of human embryonic stem cells identify context specific differences?,"Yes. Use of FGF2, WNT3A or PI3K inhibition with high activin A may serve well in definitive endoderm induction followed by BMP4 specific signaling to direct the definitive endoderm into late endodermal lineages.

1883,26728088,"White-handed gibbons (Hylobates lar) are small Asian apes known for living in stable territories and producing loud, elaborate vocalizations (songs), often in well-coordinated male/female duets. The female great call, the most conspicuous phrase of the repertoire, has been hypothesized to function in intra-sexual territorial defense. We therefore predicted that characteristics of the great call would correlate with a caller's physical condition, and thus might honestly reflect resource holding potential (RHP). Because measurement of RHP is virtually impossible for wild animals, we used age as a proxy, hypothesizing that great call climaxes are difficult to produce and maintain over time, and that older adults will therefore perform lower quality great calls than young adults. To test this we analyzed the great call climaxes of 15 wild lar gibbon females at Khao Yai National Park, Thailand and 2 captive females at Leo Conservation Center, Greenwich, CT.
Findings show that call climaxes correlate with female age, as young animals (nâ€‰=â€‰8, mean age: 12.9Â years) produced climaxes with a higher frequency range (delta F0), maximum F0 frequency and duty cycle than old animals (nâ€‰=â€‰9, mean age: 29.6Â years). A permuted discriminant function analysis also correctly classified calls by age group. During long song bouts the maximum F0 frequency of great call climaxes' also decreased. Additional data support the hypothesis that short high notes, associated with rapid inhalation as an individual catches its breath, reflect increased caller effort. Older females produced more high notes than younger females, but the difference only approached statistical significance, suggesting that calling effort may be similar across different ages.

The type 1 (AT(1)R) and type 2 (AT(2)R) receptors reciprocally regulate basal perfusion of muscle microvasculature. Unopposed AT(2)R activity increases muscle microvascular blood volume (MBV) and glucose extraction, whereas unopposed AT(1)R activity decreases both. The current study examined whether ANG II receptors modulate muscle insulin delivery and sensitivity.
Overnight-fasted rats were studied. In protocol 1, rats received a 2-h infusion of saline, insulin (3 mU/kg/min), insulin plus PD123319 (AT(2)R blocker), or insulin plus losartan (AT(1)R blocker, intravenously).

We analyzed the false-positive data of 2 urinary tumor markers, NMP22 and the BTA stat tests. We examined the clinical categories of the false-positive results, established relative exclusion criteria, and recalculated the specificity and positive predictive value after using the exclusion criteria.
A total of 278 symptomatic patients who presented to a urology clinic were asked to submit a single voided urine sample. Each sample was divided into 3 aliquots of which 1 was stabilized with the NMP22 test kit stabilizer and assayed for NMP22, 1 was tested for BTA stat and 1 was sent for cytological examination. All patients subsequently underwent office cystoscopy and bladder biopsy if indicated.

We aimed at identifying effects of CC2238/Î±ANP on viability, migration and motility in coronary artery SMCs, and the underlying signaling pathways.
Cells were exposed to either TT2238/Î±ANP or CC2238/Î±ANP. At the end of treatment, cell viability, migration and motility were evaluated, along with changes in oxidative stress pathway (ROS levels, NADPH and eNOS expression), on Akt phosphorylation and miR21 expression levels. CC2238/Î±ANP reduced cell vitality, increased apoptosis and necrosis, increased oxidative stress levels, suppressed miR21 expression along with consistent changes of its molecular targets (PDCD4, PTEN, Bcl2) and of phosphorylated Akt levels. As a result of increased oxidative stress, CC2238/Î±ANP markedly stimulated cell migration and increased cell contraction. NPR-C gene silencing with specific siRNAs restored cell viability, miR21 expression, and reduced oxidative stress induced by CC2238/Î±ANP.

Here a novel nano-complex, based on galactosylated low molecular weight chitosan (gal-LMWC) and an ASO against TNFalpha, is presented which may be effective for CD treatment. The aim of this study was to investigate the targeting delivery ability of the gal-LMWC/ASO complex into activated macrophages and its potential therapeutic action in experimental colitis.
Gal-LMWC was associated with ASO to form a stable nano-complex and the complex was injected into mice by intracolonic administration. Cellular localisation of the gal-LMWC/ASO complex in the colon was determined. The therapeutic effects were further studied in 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis and CD4(+)CD45RB(hi) T cell transfer colitis.
Intracolonic administration of the gal-LMWC/ASO complex resulted in the successful delivery of ASO into activated colonic macrophages and a significant reduction of colonic TNFalpha in mice with colitis.

New storage conditions and additives are constantly evaluated in order to achieve this. Using glucose as a substrate is controversial because of its potential connection with increased lactate production and decreased pH, both parameters triggering the platelet lesion during storage.
In this study, we analysed the morphological status and metabolic profile of platelets stored for various periods in autologous plasma enriched with increasing glucose concentrations (13.75, 27.5 and 55 mM). After 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 days, high energy phosphates (ATP, GTP, ADP, AMP), oxypurines (hypoxanthine, xanthine, uric acid), lactate, pH, mitochondrial function, cell lysis and morphology, were evaluated.
The data showed a significant dose-dependent improvement of the different parameters in platelets stored with increasing glucose, compared to what detected in controls. Interestingly, this phenomenon was more marked at the highest level of glucose tested and in the period of time generally used for platelet transfusion (0-6 days).",Does glucose ameliorate the metabolic profile and mitochondrial function of platelet concentrates during storage in autologous plasma?,"No. These results indicate that the addition of glucose during platelet storage does not ameliorate the biochemical parameters related to energy metabolism and mitochondrial function.

We previously showed that cyclic nucleotides such as cAMP and cGMP induce fetal hemoglobin expression in primary erythroid cells. Here we report that cAMP signaling contributes to high-level fetal hemoglobin expression in erythroid cells prepared from cord blood and Î²-thalassemia.
The status of the cAMP signaling pathway was investigated using primary erythroid cells prepared from cord blood and the mononuclear cells of patients with Î²-thalassemia; erythroid cells from adult bone marrow mononuclear cells served as the control.
We found that intracellular cAMP levels were higher in erythroid cells from cord blood and Î²-thalassemia than from adult bone marrow. Protein kinase A activity levels and cAMP-response element binding protein phosphorylation were higher in erythroid cells from cord blood or Î²-thalassemia than in adult bone marrow progenitors. Mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, which play a role in fetal hemoglobin expression, were not consistently activated in cord blood or Î²-thalassemia erythroid cells.

Moreover DMC significantly restored the decrease in eNOS expression induced by HF diet. Similar results were found in histopathologic changes. DMC failed to restore the loss of vasocontraction of aorta explained by an impairment of ATP-sensitive K+ channels (KATP) on the structure and/or function. DMC exerted the same protective effect as ATV, a positive control drug, on vascular injury produced by HF diet.",Does daming capsule restore endothelial dysfunction induced by high-fat diet?,Yes. DMC fully protects the aorta from HF-induced endothelial dysfunction via upregulation of the expression of eNOS.,FAIL,pubmedQA," Based on the provided context, it is not explicitly stated whether Daming capsule restores endothelial dysfunction induced by a high-fat diet. The study focuses on the effects of Ob-X, not DMC, on endothelial dysfunction and other metabolic consequences in mice fed different diets.","Daming capsule (DMC), a traditional Chinese formula, has a lipid-modulating action with reduced adverse side effects as compared with other lipid lowering compounds. Since endothelial dysfunction often accompanies the hyperlipidemic state, we hypothesize that DMC might restore endothelial dysfunction produced by a high-fat (HF) diet. Importantly, we also investigate possible mechanisms involved in mediating the effects of DMC on vascular reactivity.

We investigated the metabolic consequences of mice fed a (a) regular diet, (b) 'Western' high-fat diet or (c) regular diet supplemented with 8% HFCS in drinking water (to mimic soft drinks) for 10 months. Adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) have emerged as a major pathogenic factor for obesity and insulin resistance. ATMs consist of proinflammatory F4/80(+)CD11c(+) macrophages and anti-inflammatory F4/80(+)CD11c(-) macrophages. In this study, we assessed the effects of HFCS on ATMs in intra-abdominal fat.

Ob-X inhibited angiogenesis in a dose-dependent manner in the human umbilical vein endothelial cell tube formation assay in vitro and the rat aortic ring assay ex vivo. Ob-X also suppressed MMP activity in vitro. Administration of Ob-X to high fat diet-induced obese mice produced significant reductions in body weight gain and adipose tissue mass compared with control.

Studies have shown that cones degenerate in chromophore-deficient mouse models for Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA), but exogenous supplementation of the native 11-cis retinal chromophore can inhibit this degeneration, suggesting that 11-cis retinal could be used as a therapeutic agent for preserving functional cones in patients with LCA. However, these treated mice were maintained in the dark.
11-cis Retinal was introduced into Rpe65(-/-)Rho(-/-) mice at postnatal day 10 as a single subcutaneous injection mixed with a basement membrane matrix. The mice were maintained in either normal light/dark cycles or constant dark conditions. Fluorescence microscopy was used to assess retinal morphology. Cone cell survival was determined by counting cone opsin-containing cells on flat-mounted P30 retinas. Cross-sections of P21 mouse retina were used to assess cone cell integrity by visualizing opsin localization. Cone function was determined by electroretinography (ERG).
Previous studies have shown that 11-cis retinal-treated mice lacking RPE65 and raised in constant dark have higher cone photoreceptor cell number, improved cone opsin localization, and enhanced cone ERG signals when compared with untreated mice.

The purpose of this study was to elucidate whether apoptosis is one of the mechanisms responsible for this reduction. Apoptosis, a physiologic cell death process that stabilizes cell numbers in tissues, can be independently induced by p53.
In vivo gene transfer was used in isolated segments of balloon-injured rat carotid arteries. Genetically modified adenovirus encoding for wild-type p53 protein (AdWTp53) was applied at 8 x 10(10) plaque-forming units/mL. Control rats received either adenovirus null at the same concentration or balloon injury alone. Arteries were harvested at 24 and 48 hours after the procedure.

It has long been known that advanced age is negatively correlated with an organism's reparative and regenerative potential, but little and conflicting information is available about the effects of age on the quality of human adipose tissue derived MSCs (hAT-MSCs).

Human MSCs (hMSCs) were isolated before coronary artery bypass graft surgery and growth characteristics of hMSCs at passage 3 were observed. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Bcl-2 mRNA and protein expression from hMSCs were measured. In vivo, 45 adult male rats with MI were randomized to receive one of three treatments: old hMSCs, young hMSCs or culture medium (control) transplanted into infarcted myocardium. Echocardiography, TUNEL, immunohistochemistry and Western blot were used to assess"

Here, we investigated the role of OPN in monocyte migration, IL-17 production and osteoblasts.
OPN and IL-17 expression profiles in osteoarthritis (OA) and RA synovial fluid were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The expression of the microRNA, miR-129-3p, in osteoblasts was analyzed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Immunoreactive proteins were spotted by Western blotting. We used the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model to investigate the role of OPN in monocyte migration during RA.

We have shown previously that, following induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, prion-infected mice succumb to disease significantly earlier than controls, concomitant with the deposition of PrP(Sc) aggregates in inflamed white matter areas. In the present work, we asked whether prion disease acceleration by experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis results from infiltration of viable prion-infected immune cells into the central nervous system.
C57Bl/6 J mice underwent intraperitoneal inoculation with scrapie brain homogenates and were later induced with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by inoculation of MOG(35-55) in complete Freund's adjuvant supplemented with pertussis toxin. Spleen and lymph node cells from the co-induced animals were reactivated and subsequently injected into naÃ¯ve mice as viable cells or as cell homogenates. Control groups were infected with viable and homogenized scrapie immune cells only with complete Freund's adjuvant. Prion disease incubation times as well as levels and sites of PrP(Sc) deposition were next evaluated.

1963,24343768,"Children and adolescents with femoral fractures are almost always admitted to hospital. They invariably start their hospital experience in the Emergency Department, often requiring transfer to a specialist children's hospital. They require analgesia or anaesthesia so that radiographs can be obtained and for management of their fractures. The initial care process involves from two to six transfers from stretcher to stretcher/imaging/operating-suite table or hospital bed within the first few hours, so prompt pain relief is essential. Systemic analgesia can be provided orally or parenterally. Alternatively, a nerve block may be used where local anaesthetic is injected around a nerve to block sensation or freeze the involved area.
To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of femoral nerve block (FNB) or fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB) for initial pain management of children with fractures of the femur (thigh bone) in the pre-hospital or in-hospital emergency setting, with or without systemic analgesia.
We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (11 January 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2012 Issue 12), MEDLINE (1946 to January Week 1 2013), EMBASE (1980 to 2013 Week 01), Google Scholar (31 January 2013) and trial registries (31 January 2013). We handsearched recent issues of specialist journals and references of relevant articles.
Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials assessing the effects of FNB or FICBÂ for initial pain management compared with systemic opiates in children (aged under 18 years) with fractures of the femur receiving pre-hospital or in hospital emergency care. Primary outcomes included failure of analgesia at 30 minutes, pain levels during procedures and transfers (e.g. to a stretcher or hospital ward) for up to eight hours, and adverse effects.
Two review authors independently extracted data using a pre-piloted form. Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias for the included study and assessed quality of the evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach; i.e. as very low, low, moderate or high. Meta-analysis of results was not possible as we found only one trial that could be included in the review.
We included one randomised trial of 55 children aged between 16 months to 15 years. It compared anatomically-guided FICB versus systemic analgesia with intravenous morphine sulphate. The small sample size and the high risk of bias relating to lack of blinding resulted in a low quality rating for all outcomes.Overall, the trial provided low quality evidence for better pain management in the FICB group. Fewer children in the FICB group had analgesia failure at 30 minutes than in the morphine group (2/26 (8%) versus 8/28 (29%); risk ratio (RR) 0.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09 to 1.20; P value 0.09). The trial did not report on pain during procedures or transfers, or application of analgesia. The trial provided low quality evidence that FICB has a better safety profile than morphine, with only four (15%) reports of redness and pain at the injection site, and no reports of the type of adverse effects of systematic analgesia that occurred in the morphine group, such as respiratory depression (six cases (21%)) and vomiting (four cases (14%)). No long-term adverse events were reported for either intervention. Clinically significant pain relief was achieved in both groups at five minutes; with limited evidence of greater initial pain relief in the FICB group. Based on an inspection of graphically-presented data, at least 46% (12/26) of children in the FICB group had no supplementary medication (mainly analgesia) for the six hours of the study, while only 5% (1 or 2/28) of children in the intravenous morphine group went without additional analgesia. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether child or parental satisfaction with the method of analgesia favoured either method. Resource use was not measured.",Does nerve block for initial pain management of femoral fractures in children?,Yes.

1972,23698732,"Afamin was recently identified as a novel osteoclast-derived coupling factor that can stimulate the in vitro and in vivo migration of preosteoblasts.
In order to understand in more detail the biological roles of afamin in bone metabolism, we investigated its effects on osteoclastic differentiation and bone resorption.
Osteoclasts were differentiated from mouse bone marrow cells. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive multinucleated cells were considered as osteoclasts, and the resorption area was determined by incubating the cells on dentine discs. The intracellular cAMP level was determined using a direct enzyme immunoassay. Signaling pathways were investigated using western blot and RT-PCR. Recombinant afamin was administered exogenously to bone cell cultures.
Afamin stimulated both osteoclastogenesis and in vitro bone resorption. Consistently, the expressions of osteoclast differentiation markers were significantly increased by afamin. Although afamin mainly affected the late-differentiation stages of osteoclastogenesis, the expression levels of receptor activator of nuclear factor-ÎºB ligand (RANKL)-dependent signals were not changed. Afamin markedly decreased the levels of intracellular cAMP with reversal by pretreatment with pertussis toxin (PTX), a specific inhibitor of Gi-coupled receptor signaling. In addition, PTX almost completely blocked afamin-stimulated osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, pretreatment with KN93 and STO609 - Ca2+/cal - mo dulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) and CaMK kinase inhibitors, respectively - significantly prevented decreases in the intracellular cAMP level by afamin while attenuating afamin-stimulated osteoclastogenesis.",Does afamin stimulate osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption via Gi-coupled receptor and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ( CaMK ) pathways?,Yes.

For every point increase in EF score (that is, worsening EF) the odds of not receiving NS during surgery do not increase significantly. Although NS is not associated with worse cancer outcomes in appropriately selected patients, failure to spare nerves is associated with poor post-operative EF, urinary continence, and increased severity of cavernous venous leak. Patient anxiety related to cancer diagnosis and impending treatment may lead to falsely-worsened apparent EF when recent erections are assessed during a pre-operative planning visit. For these reasons prostatectomists should consider NS based solely on factors other than patient's baseline EF, even when it is impaired.",FAIL,pubmedQA," Yes, preoperative erectile function is an independent predictor of the decision to spare cavernous nerves during radical prostatectomy.","Cavernous nerve sparing (NS) is critical for recovery of erectile function (EF) as well as erectile tissue preservation following radical prostatectomy (RP).

However, to our knowledge, no studies have compared the use of this test with intraoperative frozen section, which is considered by many to be the best intraoperative test now available.
We asked whether intraoperative SCRP could lead to comparable sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values as intraoperative frozen section in revision total hip arthroplasty.
A prospective study was performed including 76 patients who underwent hip revision for any cause. SCRP quantification (using 9.5Â mg/L as denoting infection) and the analysis of frozen section of intraoperative samples (five or more polymorphonuclear leukocytes under high magnification in 10 fields) were performed in all the patients. The definitive diagnosis of an infection was determined according to the Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS). In this group, 30% of the patients were diagnosed with infection using the MSIS criteria (23 of 76 patients).
With the numbers available, there were no differences between SCRP and frozen section in terms of their ability to diagnose infection. The sensitivity of SCRP was 90% (95% confidence interval [CI], 70.8%-98.6%), the specificity was 94% (95% CI, 84.5%-98.7%), the positive predictive value was 87% (95% CI, 66.3%-97%), and the negative predictive value was 96% (95% CI, 87%-99.4%); the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were the same using frozen sections to diagnose infection. The positive likelihood ratio was 16.36 (95% CI, 5.4-49.5), indicating a low probability of an individual without the condition having a positive test, and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.10 (95% CI, 0.03-0.36), indicating low probability of an individual without the condition having a negative test.",Is intraoperative synovial C-reactive protein as useful as frozen section to detect periprosthetic hip infection?,"Yes.

1986,9500757,"Protein kinase A (PKA) activation is documented to be inhibitory for T helper cell (T[H1])-like cytokines (IL-2, IFN-gamma), whereas T(H2)-like cytokines (IL-4, IL-5) are not affected or upregulated. We have recently shown that IL-4 gene expression can be inhibited by PKA activation but depends on the mode of T-cell activation. For IL-5 gene expression, we hypothesized that the mode of T-cell activation also determines the ultimate effect of simultaneous PKA activation.
The objective of this study was the examination of IL-5 gene expression in healthy T cells activated with various mitogenic stimuli after simultaneous activation of PKA by dibutyryl-cAMP or prostaglandin E2 (PGE2).
IL-5 mRNA was measured by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction or Northern analysis. IL-5 protein was measured by ELISA. Transcriptional mechanisms involved in IL-5 gene expression were determined by nuclear run-on experiments and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Posttranscriptional mechanisms were determined by actinomycin D chase studies.
Anti-CD2-, anti-CD3-, and anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28-induced IL-5 mRNA were completely inhibited by dibutyryl cyclic AMP (10[-3] mol/L) and PGE2 (10[-5] mol/L), whereas concanavalin A-induced IL-5 mRNA was partially reduced. The effect of PGE2 was accomplished at the transcriptional level, probably as the result of inhibition of DNA binding of nuclear factor-kappaB. Anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28-induced IL-5 protein (504 +/- 56 pg/ml) was significantly reduced by PGE2 (122 +/- 42 pg/ml, p < 0.001).

1992,16831408,"Extracellular retention of PDGF-B has been proposed to play an important role in PDGF-B signalling. We used the PDGF-B retention motif knockout mouse (RetKO) to study the effects of retention motif deletion on development of micro- and macrovascular structure and function.
Passive and active properties of conduit vessels were studied using myograph techniques and histological examination. Capillary structure and function was studied using measurements of capillary density in skeletal muscle and by assessing aerobic physical performance in a treadmill setup. Cardiac function was assessed using echocardiography.
Myograph experiments revealed an increased diameter and stiffness of the aorta in RetKO. Histological examination showed increased media collagen content and a decreased number of aortic wall layers, however with a similar number of vascular smooth muscle cells. This outward eutrophic remodelling of the aorta was accompanied by endothelial dysfunction. RetKO showed decreased capillary density in skeletal muscle and signs of a defective delivery of capillary oxygen to skeletal muscle, as shown by a decreased physical performance. In RetKO mice, echocardiography revealed an adaptive eccentric cardiac hypertrophy.",Is platelet-derived growth factor B retention essential for development of normal structure and function of conduit vessels and capillaries?,"Yes. We conclude that retention of PDGF-B during development is essential for a normal conduit vessel function in the adult mouse. Furthermore, PDGF-B retention is also necessary for the development of an adequate capillary density, and thereby for a normal oxygen delivery to cardiac muscle. The lack of primary effects on cardiac function supports the redundant role of PDGF-B in cardiac development.",FAIL,pubmedQA," I'm sorry for any confusion, but the provided context doesn't seem to relate to platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGF-B) or the development of conduit vessels and capillaries.

These interactions involve the secretion of messengers, such as the neurotrophin nerve growth factor (NGF), which influence colonic motility and sensitivity, both affected in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This study was designed to test the hypothesis that, in children with IBS, colonic mucosal innervation, NGF content, and MC infiltration are altered. We aimed to measure MC infiltration, number of neuronal bodies, distance from MC to nerve fibers, inflammation, and NGF content in rectal mucosa of pediatric patients with IBS as compared with controls.
Rectal biopsies from children (median age: 14 years) with diarrhea-predominant IBS (n = 11) and controls (n = 14) were studied. MC and neuronal mucosal structures were identified by tryptase, CD117 and PGP9.5 immunoreactivity. Inflammatory cells (neutrophils, eosinophils, and lymphocytes) were counted. NGF was quantified in situ by ELISA.
No mucosal inflammation was detected in IBS. MC infiltration and number of neuronal bodies were not significantly different between IBS and controls. The distance between MC and nerve fibers was not different in IBS compared with controls (5.2 Â± 0.3 vs 5.0 Â± 0.3 Î¼m). Number of MC in close proximity to nerve fibers (<5 Î¼m) was not different in the two groups. However, in IBS, NGF content was higher than controls (0.93 Â± 0.3 vs 0.62 Â± 0.3 pg mg(-1) protein, P < 0.05) and significantly correlated with MC number.",Is nerve growth factor content increased in the rectal mucosa of children with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome?,"No. Regardless of inflammation, NGF content is not increased in rectal mucosa of diarrhea-predominant IBS children.",FAIL,pubmedQA," Yes, nerve growth factor content is altered in the rectal mucosa of children with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome.","The enteric nervous system is a complex network that includes, in the digestive mucosa, neuronal bodies and fibers interacting with the immune system and mucosal mast cells (MC).

1994,19250292,"Initiation and maintenance of pro-inflammatory reactions elicited by bacterial lipopolysaccharide and/or cytokines in the macrophage lineage have been reported to play a crucial role in acute and chronic pathogenic effects. Whether pro-inflammatory responses triggered by lipopolysaccharide in growth arrested cells differ from those in proliferating cells remains unanswered.
Olomoucine and roscovitine are cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors that prevent progression through the cell cycle. After treatment with CDK inhibitors, expression of pro-inflammatory genes was analysed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Protein levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) were determined by Western blotting. Promoter activity of iNOS was measured by the luciferase activity assay.
In this study we have demonstrated that both olomoucine and roscovitine inhibit cell proliferation and diminish nitric oxide production and cytokine gene expression, in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated murine RAW264.7 macrophages. In addition, olomoucine reduces iNOS promoter activity and alleviates NF-kappaB transcription activation. After co-transfection with E2F1 interference RNA, suppression of lipopolysaccharide-mediated iNOS promoter activity and NF-kappaB activation was observed. Furthermore, we demonstrated that olomoucine-induced growth arrested cells reduce expression of the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB.",Does inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases by olomoucine and roscovitine reduce lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory responses via down-regulation of nuclear factor kappaB?,Yes. The findings of this study suggest that inhibition of cell-cycle progression is capable of reducing pro-inflammatory responses via up-regulation of NF-kappaB.,FAIL,pubmedQA, The provided context does not directly address the effect of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (olomoucine and roscovitine) on lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory responses or nuclear factor kappa B.,"blood monocytes (PBMo) leading to cytokine expressions via the interaction with PKR [5] .

Mice were immunized with a purified recombinant human MPF-rabbit-Fc fusion protein and with MPF. Several hybridomas producing mAbs to MPF were established. A double-determinant (sandwich) ELISA was constructed using mAbs to two different epitopes and used to determine if MPF is present in the serum of patients with mesothelioma.
We established seven anti-MPF mAbs whose topographical epitopes were classified into three nonoverlapping groups. All the mAbs reacted with recombinant MPF protein by ELISA. One of the mAbs detected MPF and the mesothelin precursor protein containing MPF in cell lysates on Western blotting. A sandwich ELISA using mAbs to two different epitopes was constructed and used to measure the presence of MPF in the media of various mesothelin-expressing cancer cell lines and in human serum. The ELISA showed that MPF levels were elevated in 91% (51 of 56) of patients with mesothelioma compared with healthy controls. Furthermore, serum MPF fell to normal levels in two patients after surgery for their peritoneal mesothelioma.",Is megakaryocyte potentiation factor cleaved from mesothelin precursor a useful tumor marker in the serum of patients with mesothelioma?,"Yes.

Anti-inflammatory activity was uncovered using the ovalbumin-induced allergic airway inflammation model. However, further validation of this activity using knockout mice in a different allergic inflammation model is necessary in order to establish the antiallergic inflammatory role for this protein.
Scgb3a2-null (Scgb3a2-/-) mice were subjected to nasal inhalation of Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus extract for 5 days/week for 5 consecutive weeks; control mice received nasal inhalation of saline as a comparator. Airway inflammation was assessed by histological analysis, the number of inflammatory cells and various Th2-type cytokine levels in the lungs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids by qRT-PCR and ELISA, respectively.
Exacerbated inflammation was found in the airway of Scgb3a2-/- mice subjected to house dust mite (HDM)-induced allergic airway inflammation compared with saline-treated control groups. All the inflammation end points were increased in the Scgb3a2-/- mice.
