Czechoslovakia was the most prosperous country in the Eastern Bloc, however it continued to lag further behind the rest of the developed world. With the disintegration of the communist economic alliance in 1991, Czech manufacturers lost their traditional markets among former communist countries in the east.

After Carpenter's kickoff was returned from the 29-yard line by Matthew Slater, the Patriots began their first possession at their own 40-yard line. Cassel's first two passes were both completed for first downs, putting the Patriots in Dolphins territory and eventually their red zone. However, a holding penalty on Neal pushed the Patriots back 10 yards, forcing a 30-yard Gostkowski field goal four plays later that gave the Patriots a 3-0 lead. Following a Dolphins three-and-out, the Patriots' second drive ended when a Cassel pass to Moss was bobbled by both Moss and cornerback Jason Allen to keep the ball in the air until Renaldo Hill intercepted it; a 17-yard return gave the Dolphins the ball at the Patriots' 42-yard line. On the next play, a 29-yard David Martin reception moved the Dolphins into the Patriots' red zone, where the Dolphins used their ""Wildcat"" formation on the next two plays. A Tedy Bruschi unnecessary roughness penalty on the second Ronnie Brown run set up a first-and-goal, where Camarillo caught a 3-yard pass from Pennington for a touchdown, giving the Dolphins a 7-3 lead. The Patriots responded with a 12-play, 74-yard drive that ended on the first play of the second quarter, an 8-yard touchdown scramble by Cassel to give the Patriots the lead again, 10-7. The Dolphins' next drive went three-and-out despite two more plays using the ""Wildcat"" formation, giving the Patriots the ball at their own 41-yard line. On a 1-yard Morris run from the Dolphins' 28-yard line, linebacker Matt Roth forced a fumble during the tackle; the ball was recovered by Dolphins cornerback Andr&#233; Goodman at the Dolphins' 28-yard line. The Dolphins took advantage of the turnover, going 72 yards on 12 plays and re-taking the lead at 14-10 on a 7-yard Pennington touchdown scramble. Carpenter's ensuing kickoff was returned by Slater from the Patriots' 24-yard line, setting up the Patriots' next drive to begin from their own 37-yard line. Six plays later, Cassel completed a 25-yard touchdown pass to Moss that gave the Patriots the lead again, 17-14. After an exchange of three-and-outs, the Dolphins began their final drive of the half with 39 seconds remaining and moved into Patriots territory. However, a false start on wide receiver Ted Ginn, Jr. followed by a Vrabel sack of Pennington ended the first half. Due to their deferral of the opening kickoff, the Dolphins elected to receive the opening kickoff of the second half. A 46-yard Pennington pass to Ginn on the first play moved the Dolphins to the Patriots' 36-yard line; six plays later, Pennington hit fullback Casey Cramer on a 2-yard touchdown catch that gave the Dolphins the lead again at 21-17. The Patriots responded by going 78 yards on 11 plays, re-taking the lead yet again on the second Moss touchdown catch of the day; the 8-yard grab put the Patriots ahead 24-21. The Dolphins' next drive got as far as the Patriots' 27-yard line, but an offensive holding penalty, incomplete pass, and sack forced the Dolphins to punt from the Patriots' 42-yard line. Two plays later, Cassel completed a pass to Welker across the middle; the wide receiver ran along the sideline after the catch to pick up 64 yards on the play. After an incomplete pass to Moss, a 21-yard Faulk touchdown run extended the Patriots' lead to 31-21 on the final play of the third quarter. Four plays into the Dolphins' ensuing drive, on 3rd-and-3, Pennington hit wide receiver Davone Bess for a 36-yard gain to put the Dolphins in the Patriots' red zone. On the next play, a diving Ricky Williams 13-yard touchdown catch cut the Patriots' lead to 31-28. Facing a 3rd-and-10 from their own 42-yard line during their next drive, the Patriots moved into Dolphins territory on a 23-yard Gaffney catch. Two plays later, Cassel and Moss connected for their third touchdown pass of the day, this one from 29 yards out, to give the Patriots a 38-28 lead. On the next play, Meriweather intercepted a Pennington pass and returned it 19 yards to the Dolphins' 18-yard line. However, safety Yeremiah Bell sacked Cassel on 3rd-and-2 to set up a 30-yard Gostkowski field goal that extended the Patriots lead to 41-28 with just over seven minutes remaining in the game.

In 1948, under pressure from their World War II allies and to the dismay of the Somalis, the British returned the Haud  and the Ogaden to Ethiopia, based on a treaty they signed in 1897 in which the British, French and Italians agreed upon the territorial boundaries of Ethiopia with the Ethiopian Emperor Menelik in exchange for his help against raids by hostile clans. Britain included the provision that the Somali residents would retain their autonomy, but Ethiopia immediately claimed sovereignty over the area. This prompted an unsuccessful bid by Britain in 1956 to buy back the Somali lands it had turned over. Britain also granted administration of the almost exclusively Somali-inhabited Northern Frontier District  to Kenyan nationalists despite an informal plebiscite demonstrating the overwhelming desire of the region's population to join the newly formed Somali Republic."", 'score': 1.2109375, 'rank': 1, 'document_id': '02019405-6712-43e5-b096-c5a53ae587f2', 'passage_id': 0}]"

757,8b1f9288-bfc7-4d10-a5b8-8ef26b90c5b9," During the eighth week of the season, the Bears went to the Mercedes-Benz Superdome to play the New Orleans Saints, who trailed the series 15-14 but had won every meeting since 2011. Jeff Joniak wrote a goal of the Bears offense would be to get into scoring position; since Mitchell Trubisky became the starter, the offense had entered the red zone only twice in three games, with both trips ending in field goals. Upon reaching the 20-yard line, using the running game would be ideal; Jordan Howard ranked fifth in the league in rushing, second in yards after contact, and led the offense rushing first downs with 32. In contrast, the Saints defense ranked 30th in rushing yards allowed per carry. Joniak also emphasized the need for Trubisky to tune out the loud Superdome crowd and lead the offense without making errors. For the defense, it faced Drew Brees, who, according to Joniak, was to be pressured quickly if the Bears were to succeed - while being blitzed, Brees was intercepted three times and sacked twice. Otherwise, Brees was successful in quickly passing the ball for gains of six yards in a fast-paced offense. Turnovers were also priority; in the last two games, the Bears had forced six and scored on three, and while Brees had recorded turnovers in his last two games, the Saints still had the fifth-best turnover difference. On the Saints' opening possession, Will Lutz was lining up for a 32-yard field goal attempt when Kyle Fuller was penalized for jumping offsides. This set up Alvin Kamara's eight-yard touchdown run to put New Orleans up by seven points. After the next two drives resulted in punts, Connor Barth made a 27-yard field goal in the second quarter, though Mark Ingram Jr. scored on a one-yard touchdown run. Barth missed a 48-yard field goal wide left late in the first half as the Bears entered halftime with an 11-point deficit. In the third quarter, Trubisky threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to Zach Miller, who landed on his knee and dislocated it in the process. The touchdown was eventually nullified when referee Carl Cheffers determined Miller had let go of the ball in pain while on the ground. The Bears were forced to settle for Barth's 44-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, Lutz kicked a 45-yard field goal to increase the lead to 17-6. With 7:32 remaining in the game, Jonathan Bullard stripped Ingram and Christian Jones recovered the fumble. Aided by Trubisky's 46-yard run, Tarik Cohen dove into the end zone from the Saints' one-yard line to score the offense's first touchdown in 25 series (dating back to the Baltimore game). The Bears failed to score on the two-point conversion but were just five points down. Chicago forced another takeaway when Adrian Amos stripped and recovered the ball from Ingram with 2:12 left. Although the Bears turned the ball over on downs, they had another chance after Lutz's 49-yard field goal put them behind by eight points. However, Trubisky's pass for Tre McBride was intercepted by Marshon Lattimore to seal the loss. Miller was taken to the University Medical Center New Orleans for treatment. In addition to a dislocated knee, Miller was revealed to have torn the popliteal artery in his region, an injury that is common in car accidents and raised the possibility of amputation. Vascular surgery was successfully completed the day after the game. The overturning of Miller's catch was controversial. Cheffers defended the call, stating when Miller was falling to the turf, he ""has to survive the ground. He went to the ground, he temporarily lost control of the ball. The ball hit the ground; therefore it's incomplete."" The NFL's Vice President of Officiating Alberto Riveron also maintained Miller had not completed the catch, but predecessors Mike Pereira and Dean Blandino argued otherwise.

In 1944, after Horthy's government negotiated secretly with the Allies, and considered to leave the war as well, Hungary was occupied by Nazi Germany and Horthy was deposed. The Arrow Cross Party's leader Ferenc SzÃƒÂ¡lasi established a new Nazi-backed government, effectively turning Hungary into a German-occupied puppet state. After World War II, Hungary fell within the Soviet Union's sphere of interest. In 1946, the Second Hungarian Republic was established under Soviet influence. In 1949, the communist Hungarian People's Republic was founded."", 'score': 0.615234375, 'rank': 1, 'document_id': 'a4b85dfe-02a1-4ad3-95e3-c275d4f11aa4', 'passage_id': 0}]"

This was the first game between the two at Soldier Field since 2003, where the Bears won 24-21, and the first since 2011, when the Raiders won 25-20 in Oakland. The Bears offense faced a defense led by defensive end Khalil Mack, while the secondary is guided by 39-year old Charles Woodson, who possessed 61 career interceptions, and had sealed the Raiders' win the previous week against the Browns. However, the Raiders had struggled against tight ends, allowing five catches of at least 25 yards, with a total of 20 catches for 298 yards and five touchdowns across the first three games. On defense, Chicago was against quarterback Derek Carr, who led the Raiders offense to 74 combined points in the last two games, along with rookie receiver Amari Cooper, who had 20 receptions entering the game, while also recording a 68-yard touchdown in week two. Jeff Joniak wrote that the Bears had to prevent the Raiders from gaining yardage after touching the ball; the Raiders were seventh in yards after the catch, while Latavius Murray - who had recorded 139 rushing yards in week three, was ranked fourth in the league in rushing yards and was leading the AFC in yards per carry with 4.8 - ranked fifth in yards after contact. Cooper had 177 yards after the catch, the second-most in the league among wide receivers, while 53.7 percent of Carr's passing yards occurred due to these plays. In comparison, the Bears allowed the fewest yards after contact.

Cutler's next pass to Marquess Wilson fell incomplete, and Forte's seven-yard run led to another third-down situation, which led to Cutler's first-down conversion of seven yards to Wilson with 56 seconds left. On the next set of downs, Cutler's pass for receiver Cameron Meredith was overthrown, though a 12-yard pass to Royal allowed the offense to enter Oakland territory, where the Bears elected to use a timeout with 40 seconds remaining.

846,32531770-cac5-470b-b048-8f1e9c64156f," Returning to Soldier Field for week four, the Bears hosted the Oakland Raiders, who held a 7-6 all-time lead entering the game. This was the first game between the two at Soldier Field since 2003, where the Bears won 24-21, and the first since 2011, when the Raiders won 25-20 in Oakland. The Bears offense faced a defense led by defensive end Khalil Mack, while the secondary is guided by 39-year old Charles Woodson, who possessed 61 career interceptions, and had sealed the Raiders' win the previous week against the Browns. However, the Raiders had struggled against tight ends, allowing five catches of at least 25 yards, with a total of 20 catches for 298 yards and five touchdowns across the first three games. On defense, Chicago was against quarterback Derek Carr, who led the Raiders offense to 74 combined points in the last two games, along with rookie receiver Amari Cooper, who had 20 receptions entering the game, while also recording a 68-yard touchdown in week two. Jeff Joniak wrote that the Bears had to prevent the Raiders from gaining yardage after touching the ball; the Raiders were seventh in yards after the catch, while Latavius Murray - who had recorded 139 rushing yards in week three, was ranked fourth in the league in rushing yards and was leading the AFC in yards per carry with 4.8 - ranked fifth in yards after contact. Cooper had 177 yards after the catch, the second-most in the league among wide receivers, while 53.7 percent of Carr's passing yards occurred due to these plays. In comparison, the Bears allowed the fewest yards after contact. David Fales, punter Patrick O'Donnell, Alshon Jeffery, Ka'Deem Carey, Hroniss Grasu, tackle Jermon Bushrod and nose tackle Jeremiah Ratliff were inactive. The Raiders won the coin toss and deferred in the second half. The Bears managed to record an 80-yard drive to score on the opening possession via Jay Cutler's seven-yard touchdown pass to Eddie Royal. During the drive, lineman Charles Leno landed on center Will Montgomery's leg, injuring the latter and prompting Matt Slauson to replace him. Robbie Gould's extra point was blocked, and his struggles continued with the following kickoff when his squib kick bounced out of bounds. After the game's four next drives culminated with punts, the Raiders scored on Carr's 26-yard touchdown pass to Cooper; despite initially being ruled out of bounds, the Raiders challenged the call and the ruling was overturned. On the Bears' next series, Slauson botched the snap to Cutler, and the Raiders' Dan Williams recovered. Oakland capitalized on the takeaway with Roy Helu scoring on a four-yard touchdown reception, though the Bears responded with Cutler taking advantage of an open Martellus Bennett to score on a five-yard touchdown. On Oakland's next drive, Carr's swing pass to Murray was deflected and landed towards Pernell McPhee, intercepting the pass; Gould eventually kicked a 19-yard field goal. In the second half, the Raiders punted on the first drive, though they reclaimed the ball after Stacy McGee recovered Matt Forte's fumble. Oakland eventually took the lead with Sebastian Janikowski's 29-yard field goal. Gould eventually gave the Bears the lead back with Gould's 54-yard kick, and reclaimed possession of the ball with Murray dropping a pitch and Sam Acho recovered. However, the Bears gave the ball back when Cutler's pass for Bennett fell short and was intercepted by Woodson, leading to Janikowski's 41-yard field goal. With 2:05 left in the game, Cutler began leading a two-minute drill: after a six-yard run by Forte, followed by a sack by Mack and incomplete pass to Josh Bellamy to bring up fourth down, Cutler successfully converted with a seven-yard pass to Bennett, who beat Keenan Lambert. Cutler's next pass to Marquess Wilson fell incomplete, and Forte's seven-yard run led to another third-down situation, which led to Cutler's first-down conversion of seven yards to Wilson with 56 seconds left. On the next set of downs, Cutler's pass for receiver Cameron Meredith was overthrown, though a 12-yard pass to Royal allowed the offense to enter Oakland territory, where the Bears elected to use a timeout with 40 seconds remaining. The offense entered field goal range with Cutler's nine-yard pass to Wilson, followed by a two-yard run by Forte. With seven seconds left, the Bears used another timeout, and allowed Gould to attempt the 49-yard field goal; Gould successfully converted the field goal with two seconds remaining on the clock to give the Bears the 22-20 lead. In an last-second attempt to score, the Raiders attempted lateral passes on the kickoff return, but were penalized for an illegal lateral in the early stages of the play, and the Bears eventually recovered to clinch the win. Gould was later named the NFC Special Teams Player of the Week, his third ST POTW honor and tying him with kickers Jeff Jaeger and Paul Edinger for the most in team history. The field goal was Gould's eleventh career game-winner. Forte ran for 91 yards in the game to increase his career rushing yards total to 8,071, becoming the 14th player in NFL history to record 8,000 and 3,500 career rushing and receiving yards, respectively, while becoming the second-fastest player to achieve the milestone with 111 games.

This was the first game between the two at Soldier Field since 2003, where the Bears won 24-21, and the first since 2011, when the Raiders won 25-20 in Oakland. The Bears offense faced a defense led by defensive end Khalil Mack, while the secondary is guided by 39-year old Charles Woodson, who possessed 61 career interceptions, and had sealed the Raiders' win the previous week against the Browns. However, the Raiders had struggled against tight ends, allowing five catches of at least 25 yards, with a total of 20 catches for 298 yards and five touchdowns across the first three games.

Cooper had 177 yards after the catch, the second-most in the league among wide receivers, while 53.7 percent of Carr's passing yards occurred due to these plays.

After Carpenter's kickoff was returned from the 29-yard line by Matthew Slater, the Patriots began their first possession at their own 40-yard line. Cassel's first two passes were both completed for first downs, putting the Patriots in Dolphins territory and eventually their red zone. However, a holding penalty on Neal pushed the Patriots back 10 yards, forcing a 30-yard Gostkowski field goal four plays later that gave the Patriots a 3-0 lead. Following a Dolphins three-and-out, the Patriots' second drive ended when a Cassel pass to Moss was bobbled by both Moss and cornerback Jason Allen to keep the ball in the air until Renaldo Hill intercepted it; a 17-yard return gave the Dolphins the ball at the Patriots' 42-yard line. On the next play, a 29-yard David Martin reception moved the Dolphins into the Patriots' red zone, where the Dolphins used their ""Wildcat"" formation on the next two plays. A Tedy Bruschi unnecessary roughness penalty on the second Ronnie Brown run set up a first-and-goal, where Camarillo caught a 3-yard pass from Pennington for a touchdown, giving the Dolphins a 7-3 lead. The Patriots responded with a 12-play, 74-yard drive that ended on the first play of the second quarter, an 8-yard touchdown scramble by Cassel to give the Patriots the lead again, 10-7. The Dolphins' next drive went three-and-out despite two more plays using the ""Wildcat"" formation, giving the Patriots the ball at their own 41-yard line. On a 1-yard Morris run from the Dolphins' 28-yard line, linebacker Matt Roth forced a fumble during the tackle; the ball was recovered by Dolphins cornerback Andr&#233; Goodman at the Dolphins' 28-yard line. The Dolphins took advantage of the turnover, going 72 yards on 12 plays and re-taking the lead at 14-10 on a 7-yard Pennington touchdown scramble. Carpenter's ensuing kickoff was returned by Slater from the Patriots' 24-yard line, setting up the Patriots' next drive to begin from their own 37-yard line. Six plays later, Cassel completed a 25-yard touchdown pass to Moss that gave the Patriots the lead again, 17-14. After an exchange of three-and-outs, the Dolphins began their final drive of the half with 39 seconds remaining and moved into Patriots territory.

In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in an intensive recruitment campaign, the ""Lenin Levy"", resulting in new members referred to as the Lenin Enrolment, from both the working class and rural areas. This represented an attempt to ""proletarianize"" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the Old Bolsheviks and reducing their influence in the Party. In 1925, the party had 1,025,000 members in a Soviet population of 147 million. In 1927, membership had risen to 1,200,000. During the collectivization campaign and industrialization campaigns of the first five-year plan from 1929 to 1933, party membership grew rapidly to approximately 3.5 million members. However, party leaders suspected that the mass intake of new members had allowed ""social-alien elements"" to penetrate the partys ranks and document verifications of membership ensued in 1933 and 1935, removing supposedly unreliable members. Meanwhile, the party closed its ranks to new members from 1933 to November 1936. Even after the reopening of party recruiting, membership fell to 1.9 million by 1939.

In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in an intensive recruitment campaign, the ""Lenin Levy"", resulting in new members referred to as the Lenin Enrolment, from both the working class and rural areas. This represented an attempt to ""proletarianize"" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the Old Bolsheviks and reducing their influence in the Party. In 1925, the party had 1,025,000 members in a Soviet population of 147 million. In 1927, membership had risen to 1,200,000. During the collectivization campaign and industrialization campaigns of the first five-year plan from 1929 to 1933, party membership grew rapidly to approximately 3.5 million members. However, party leaders suspected that the mass intake of new members had allowed ""social-alien elements"" to penetrate the partys ranks and document verifications of membership ensued in 1933 and 1935, removing supposedly unreliable members.

Formed officially on 20 August 1941, the Reichskommissariat Ukraine - stretching from prewar east-central Poland to Crimea - had become operational theatre of the Einsatzgruppe C. Within the Soviet Union proper, between 9 July 1941 and 19 September 1941 the city of Zhytomyr was made Judenfrei in three murder operations conducted by German and Ukrainian police in which 10,000 Jews perished. In the Kamianets-Podilskyi massacre of 26-28 August 1941 some 23,600 Jews were shot in front of open pits (including 14,000-18,000 people expelled from Hungary). After an 1941 Bila Tserkva massacre in which 90 small children left behind had to be shot separately, Paul Blobel requested that Jewish mothers hold them in their arms during mass shootings. Long before the conference at Wannsee, 28,000 Jews were shot by SS and Ukrainian military in Vinnytsia on 22 September 1941, followed by the 29 September massacre of 33,771 Jews at Babi Yar. In Dnipropetrovsk, on 13 October 1941 some 10,000-15,000 Jews were shot. In Chernihiv, 10,000 Jews were put to death and only 260 Jews were spared.

In the first quarter, the Bears drew first blood as kicker Robbie Gould nailed a 22-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Bears increased their lead with Gould nailing a 42-yard field goal. They increased their lead with Cutler firing a 7-yard TD pass to tight end Greg Olsen.

In the third quarter, the Vikes started to rally with running back Adrian Peterson's 1-yard touchdown run (with the extra point attempt blocked). The Bears increased their lead over the Vikings with Cutler's 2-yard TD pass to tight end Desmond Clark.

Due to the Saints losing to Tampa Bay 20-17 in overtime the previous day, the Vikings needed to win their last two games and have the Saints lose to Carolina the next week in order to clinch homefield advantage. In the first quarter, the Bears drew first blood as kicker Robbie Gould nailed a 22-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Bears increased their lead with Gould nailing a 42-yard field goal. They increased their lead with Cutler firing a 7-yard TD pass to tight end Greg Olsen.

893,dc62e06c-7f3d-4957-93da-85d09525c7b9," Looking to avoid back-to-back divisional losses, the Patriots traveled to Miami to face the 6-4 Dolphins at Dolphin Stadium. After Carpenter's kickoff was returned from the 29-yard line by Matthew Slater, the Patriots began their first possession at their own 40-yard line. Cassel's first two passes were both completed for first downs, putting the Patriots in Dolphins territory and eventually their red zone. However, a holding penalty on Neal pushed the Patriots back 10 yards, forcing a 30-yard Gostkowski field goal four plays later that gave the Patriots a 3-0 lead. Following a Dolphins three-and-out, the Patriots' second drive ended when a Cassel pass to Moss was bobbled by both Moss and cornerback Jason Allen to keep the ball in the air until Renaldo Hill intercepted it; a 17-yard return gave the Dolphins the ball at the Patriots' 42-yard line. On the next play, a 29-yard David Martin reception moved the Dolphins into the Patriots' red zone, where the Dolphins used their ""Wildcat"" formation on the next two plays. A Tedy Bruschi unnecessary roughness penalty on the second Ronnie Brown run set up a first-and-goal, where Camarillo caught a 3-yard pass from Pennington for a touchdown, giving the Dolphins a 7-3 lead. The Patriots responded with a 12-play, 74-yard drive that ended on the first play of the second quarter, an 8-yard touchdown scramble by Cassel to give the Patriots the lead again, 10-7. The Dolphins' next drive went three-and-out despite two more plays using the ""Wildcat"" formation, giving the Patriots the ball at their own 41-yard line. On a 1-yard Morris run from the Dolphins' 28-yard line, linebacker Matt Roth forced a fumble during the tackle; the ball was recovered by Dolphins cornerback Andr&#233; Goodman at the Dolphins' 28-yard line. The Dolphins took advantage of the turnover, going 72 yards on 12 plays and re-taking the lead at 14-10 on a 7-yard Pennington touchdown scramble. Carpenter's ensuing kickoff was returned by Slater from the Patriots' 24-yard line, setting up the Patriots' next drive to begin from their own 37-yard line. Six plays later, Cassel completed a 25-yard touchdown pass to Moss that gave the Patriots the lead again, 17-14. After an exchange of three-and-outs, the Dolphins began their final drive of the half with 39 seconds remaining and moved into Patriots territory. However, a false start on wide receiver Ted Ginn, Jr. followed by a Vrabel sack of Pennington ended the first half. Due to their deferral of the opening kickoff, the Dolphins elected to receive the opening kickoff of the second half. A 46-yard Pennington pass to Ginn on the first play moved the Dolphins to the Patriots' 36-yard line; six plays later, Pennington hit fullback Casey Cramer on a 2-yard touchdown catch that gave the Dolphins the lead again at 21-17. The Patriots responded by going 78 yards on 11 plays, re-taking the lead yet again on the second Moss touchdown catch of the day; the 8-yard grab put the Patriots ahead 24-21. The Dolphins' next drive got as far as the Patriots' 27-yard line, but an offensive holding penalty, incomplete pass, and sack forced the Dolphins to punt from the Patriots' 42-yard line. Two plays later, Cassel completed a pass to Welker across the middle; the wide receiver ran along the sideline after the catch to pick up 64 yards on the play. After an incomplete pass to Moss, a 21-yard Faulk touchdown run extended the Patriots' lead to 31-21 on the final play of the third quarter. Four plays into the Dolphins' ensuing drive, on 3rd-and-3, Pennington hit wide receiver Davone Bess for a 36-yard gain to put the Dolphins in the Patriots' red zone. On the next play, a diving Ricky Williams 13-yard touchdown catch cut the Patriots' lead to 31-28. Facing a 3rd-and-10 from their own 42-yard line during their next drive, the Patriots moved into Dolphins territory on a 23-yard Gaffney catch. Two plays later, Cassel and Moss connected for their third touchdown pass of the day, this one from 29 yards out, to give the Patriots a 38-28 lead. On the next play, Meriweather intercepted a Pennington pass and returned it 19 yards to the Dolphins' 18-yard line. However, safety Yeremiah Bell sacked Cassel on 3rd-and-2 to set up a 30-yard Gostkowski field goal that extended the Patriots lead to 41-28 with just over seven minutes remaining in the game. Starting from their own 1-yard after a Ginn kick return for a loss and a holding penalty, the Dolphins moved the ball as far as their 44-yard line on 10 plays, but could not successfully convert on fourth down to turn the ball back over to the Patriots. The Patriots, with just four minutes remaining in the game, exclusively ran Green-Ellis running plays on their ensuing possession, moving into the Dolphins' red zone on back-to-back unnecessary roughness and unsportsmanlike conduct penalties by Porter. On the six play of the drive, a fourth down, Green-Ellis ran for a 1-yard touchdown to give the Patriots a 48-28 lead. Down by 20 points, the Dolphins ran one play in the remaining 37 seconds to end the game and improve the Patriots' record to 7-4. The Patriots' 530 net yards of offense were the second highest output in team history, behind the Patriots' 597 yards in 1979.

His 52 homers made him the sixth youngest to ever reach 50 homers and were the highest total ever by a shortstop, surpassing Ernie Banks record of 47 in 1958, and also the most ever for an infielder other than a 1st baseman, breaking Phillies 3B Mike Schmidts mark of 48 in 1980. It was his 5th 30-homer campaign, tying Banks for most ever by a shortstop. He also tied for the league lead in extra-base hits (87) and ranked third in RBIs (135) and slugging (.622). He was also among the AL leaders in hits (4th, 201), average (7th, .318), and on-base percentage (8th, .399). He established Rangers club records for homers, runs, total bases, and hit by pitches, had the 2nd most extra-base hits, and the fourth-highest RBI total. He led the club in runs, hits, doubles (34), homers, RBI, slugging, and on-base percentage and was second in walks (75), stolen bases (18), and game-winning RBI (14) while posting career highs for homers, RBI, and total bases. Rodriguez started 161 games at shortstop and one as the Designated hitter, the only major league player to start all of his teams games in 2001.', 'score': 1.9423828125, 'rank': 1, 'document_id': 'ddded686-fdbb-450c-b030-25f3a89ae7e4', 'passage_id': 0}]"
