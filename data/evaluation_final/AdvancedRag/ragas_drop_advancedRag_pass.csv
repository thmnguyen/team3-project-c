How many did it fail to dislodge the Burmese from?,"['Although it failed to dislodge the Burmese from Kengtung and Sipsongpanna at the beginning of the century , Siam never gave up its claims on these lands. They tested the waters in 1849, by raiding as far north as Kengtung. But when the Second Anglo-Burmese War started, the Siamese viewed it as their opportunity to take over the trans-Salween states. In late 1852, a large infantry and elephant force marched from Chiang Mai and launched a two-pronged invasion of Kengtung. Burma couldrespond only after the new king Mindon had seized power in February 1853. Because he was still concerned about the British threat, Mindon could only send several thousand infantry troops from the Mone  garrison to relieve the Siamese siege of Kengtung. With the troops by Kenghung sawbwa, the Burmese eventually drove out the Siamese but only after heavy loss of life. In 1854, the largest Siamese invasion force, consisted of Laotian levies, tried once more. But this time, with the British front quiet, the Burmese were ready. Mindon had deployed a larger, well-equipped army . The Siamese forces again reached Kengtung but could not break through. The Siamese forces withdrew to the border in May 1855.']"," The question does not specify who or what was being dislodged from Kengtung and Sipsongpanna, so it is impossible to determine how many were affected based on the provided context.","2, 2",0.5,0,0.384764823

To calculate the total number of families, we can use the percentages given for each family type and apply them to the total number of households:

1. Married couples living together: 52.70% * 149,957 = 79,836 families
2. Families with a female householder (no husband present): 7.70% * 149,957 = 11,679 families
3. Non-families: 37.00% * 149,957 = 56,826 non-families

Now we can find the total number of families by adding up the three family types:

Total Families = Married couples + Female householder + Non-families
                      = 79,836 + 11,679 + 0 (since there are no other family types mentioned)
                      = 91,525 families

Since the total number of households is 149,957 and the total number of families is 91,525, there are indeed more households than families. The difference between the two numbers represents the households that do not fall into any of the family categories mentioned in the context (e.g., single individuals living alone who are neither children nor part of a family).",5249,1,0.904052611,0.407692763

"Which happened first, Gustavus Adolphus succeeding to the Swedish throne, or his pressing his brother's claim to the Russian throne?","[""In 1611 a Swedish expeditionary corps under Jacob De la Gardie captured Novgorod. The Novgorodians asked the Swedish king to install one of his sons â€” Carl Filip or Gustavus Adolphus â€” as their monarch. In the meantime, Gustavus Adolphus succeeded to the Swedish throne. The young king decided to press his brother's claim to the Russian throne even after the Poles had been expelled from Moscow by a patriotic uprising of 1612 and Mikhail Romanov had been elected a new tsar. While the Swedish statesmen envisaged the creation of a Trans-Baltic dominion extending northwards to Archangelsk and eastwards to Vologda, De la Gardie and other Swedish soldiers, still holding Novgorod and Ingria, saw the war as a reaction for their forces not receiving payment for their succour during the De la Gardie Campaign. In 1613 they advanced towards Tikhvin and laid a siege to the city, but were repelled. The Russian counter-offensive failed to regain Novgorod, however. The Russian tsar refused to commit his troops to battle and the war lumbered on until 1614, when the Swedes captured Gdov. The following year they laid siege to Pskov but Russian generals Morozov and Buturlin held their own until 27 February 1617, when the Treaty of Stolbovo stripped Russia of its access to the Baltic Sea and awarded to Sweden the province of Ingria with the townships of Ivangorod, Jama, Koporye and Noteborg. Novgorod and Gdov were to be restituted to Russia. As a result of the war, Russia was denied access to the Baltic sea for about a century, despite its persistent efforts to reverse the situation.

The events unfolded as follows: In 1611, a Swedish expeditionary corps under Jacob De la Gardie captured Novgorod and the Novgorodians asked the Swedish king (Gustavus Adolphus' father) to install one of his sons as their monarch. Gustavus Adolphus succeeded to the Swedish throne in 1611, following his father's death. Later, he decided to press his brother's claim to the Russian throne despite the Poles being expelled from Moscow and Mikhail Romanov being elected as the new tsar of Russia in 1612. The war between Sweden and Russia over this claim lasted until 1617, resulting in the Treaty of Stolbovo, which stripped Russia of its access to the Baltic Sea and awarded Ingria (including Novgorod) to Sweden.",Gustavus Adolphus,0.6,0.845283379,0.496243494

"Which event was a result of the other, the formation of the Restored Reformed Church or the 2004 merger of Lutheran and Reformed Churches?","[""The Dutch Reformed Church remained the largest church body in the Netherlands until the middle of the 20th century, when it was overtaken by the Roman Catholic Church. The rapid secularisation of the Netherlands in the 1960s dramatically reduced participation in the mainstream Protestant church. From the '60s onward, a number of attempts were made to effect a reunion with the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands . This led to the two churches uniting with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Kingdom of the Netherlands  to establish the Protestant Church in the Netherlands in 2004. The 2004 merger led to a separation in which a number of congregations and members of the Dutch Reformed Church separated to form the Restored Reformed Church . Estimations of their membership vary from 35,000 up to 70,000 in about 120 local congregations served by 88 ministers. The Restored Reformed Church disapproves of the pluralistic nature of the merged church, which they allege contains partly contradicting Reformed and Lutheran confessions.

The Mongol armies pushed farther south into the Irrawaddy valley. They took the ancient Burmese capital of Tagaung, about 380Â\xa0km north of Pagan on 5 February 1284. There, the invaders paused their advance. They found the heat of the searing Irrawaddy valley excessive, and evacuated Tagaung, allowing the Burmese to return to Tagaung on 10 May 1284. But the Mongol army renewed their offensive in the following dry season. They retook Tagaung, and defeated another Burmese stand south of Tagaung, probably near Hanlin, on 26 January 1285, opening the way to Pagan, about 270Â\xa0km south. After the defeat, the king panicked, and fled to Lower Burma. The evacuation proved premature. The Mongol forces did not advance on Pagan as it was not part of their invasion plan. The country fell into chaos. In Lower Burma, the king found himself isolated, let alone plan a counterattack. Although his sons ruled the key Lower Burma ports , the king did not trust any of them, and he and his court settled at Hlegya, west of Prome.

How many years passed between the founding of the Hanthawaddy Kingdom and the invasion of Lower Burma?,"['In 1740, the Mon of Lower Burma revolted against the Toungoo Dynasty and founded the Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom based in Pegu . Throughout the 1740s, the Hanthawaddy forces were winning against Upper Burma-based Toungoo armies. The Siamese were concerned by another rising power in Burma since a strong Burma historically meant future invasions to Siam.  Concerned, the Siamese court readily gave protection to the Burmese governors of Martaban  and Tavoy who had fled to Siam. In 1745, they sent a diplomatic mission to Ava  to evaluate the political situation there, and were received by the Burmese king Mahadhammaraza Dipadi. They saw an Ava court that was on its last legs. By 1751, Restored Hanthawaddy forces were closing in on Ava. The Siamese concerns about the emergence of another strong dynasty based in Pegu appeared imminent. Perhaps as a precautionary measure, the Siamese decided to move their forward base into the upper coast in 1751.  While it remains unclear as to whether the Siamese ever intended  to go beyond the coast into mainland Lower Burma, the Siamese action nonetheless rang alarm bells in Pegu. Deeply concerned, the Hanthawaddy leadership withdrew two-thirds of their army back down to Lower Burma immediately after they had toppled the last Toungoo king in April 1752. This redeployment of Hanthawaddy troops proved a critical turning point in Burmese history as it gave nascent Upper Burmese resistance groups much needed breathing room.

What was the value of the decreased Crown against the Austro-Hungarian currency?,"[""The Czech lands were among the first industrialized countries in continental Europe during the German Confederation era. The Czech industrial tradition dates back to the 19th century, when the Lands of the Bohemian Crown were the economic and industrial heartland of the Austrian Empire and later the Austrian side of Austria-Hungary. The Czech lands produced a majority  of all industrial goods in the Empire, some of which were almost monopolistic. The Czechoslovak crown was introduced in April 1919. Introduced at a 1:1 ratio to the Austro-Hungarian currency, it became one of the most stable currencies in Europe. The First Republic became one of the 10 most developed countries of the world . The consequences of the 1938 Munich Agreement and subsequent occupation were disastrous for the economy. After the occupation and forced subordination of the economy to German economic interests, the crown was officially pegged to the mark at a ratio of 1:10, even though the unofficial exchange rate was 1 to 6-7 and Germans immediately started buying Czech goods in large quantities. In accordance with Stalin's development policy of planned interdependence, all the economies of the socialist countries were tightly linked to that of the Soviet Union. Czechoslovakia was the most prosperous country in the Eastern Bloc, however it continued to lag further behind the rest of the developed world. With the disintegration of the communist economic alliance in 1991, Czech manufacturers lost their traditional markets among former communist countries in the east. Today, this heritage is both an asset and a liability. The Czech Republic has a well-educated population and a well-developed infrastructure.""]"," After the occupation of Czechoslovakia by Germany in 1938, the official exchange rate of the Czechoslovak crown to the German mark was set at 1:10, but the unofficial exchange rate was around 1:6-7. This means that 1 Czechoslovak crown was worth approximately 1/10 (or 0.1) of a German mark in official terms, and about 1/6 to 1/7 (around 0.14 to 0.15) in unofficial terms. However, it's important to note that this question is asking about the decrease in value of the Czechoslovak crown against the Austro-Hungarian currency, not the German mark.

Before the Munich Agreement, the Czechoslovak crown was introduced at a 1:1 ratio to the Austro-Hungarian currency. After the agreement, the exchange rate changed significantly, with the Czechoslovak crown decreasing in value against the Austro-Hungarian currency. However, without specific numbers, it's difficult to provide an exact decrease in value.

In terms of the post-WWII period, after the communist takeover in 1948, the Czechoslovak crown was pegged to the Soviet ruble at a rate of 1:20. This means that 1 Czechoslovak crown was worth approximately 1/20 (or 0.05) of a Soviet ruble. After the Velvet Revolution in 1989 and the subsequent dissolution of Czechoslovakia, the Czech Republic adopted the Czech koruna as its currency, which is not directly comparable to the crown used during the Austro-Hungarian era or under communist rule.","1:10, 1:10",0.545454545,0,0.194129818

Towards the end of 1772, seeing that only a limited number of people actually handed in books, the Qianlong Emperor issued imperial decrees stressing that books would be returned to their owners once the compilation was finished and that owners of the books would not be persecuted if their books contained anti-Manchu sentiment.

4. Since all families and non-family households are included in the total number of people, we can find the total population by adding the number of families and non-family households: Total population = Families + Non-family households = 106,664 + 102,860 = 209,524

5. Now, to find out how many more people are there than families, we subtract the number of families from the total population: People - Families = Total population - Families = 209,524 - 106,664 = 102,860

Agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe, and included a diverse range of taxa.

Rye was cultivated by at least 11,050 BC. From around 11,500 years ago, the eight Neolithic founder crops, emmer wheat and einkorn wheat, hulled barley, peas, lentils, Vicia ervilia, chick peas and flax were cultivated in the Levant.

Sheep were domesticated in Mesopotamia between 13,000 and 11,000 years ago. Cattle were domesticated from the wild aurochs in the areas of modern Turkey and Pakistan some 10,500 years ago. Domestic pigs had multiple centres of origin in Eurasia, including Europe, East Asia and Southwest Asia, where wild boar were first domesticated about 10,500 years ago.

"How many deaths occurred for the Bavarian's two weeks after the Bavarian side had already lost 1,100 men?","[""The popular uprising included large areas of Lower Bavaria, the Innviertel and eastern Bavaria. The lands adjoining towns and strongholds were captured by the rebels and the peasant uprising spread to the Bavarian Forest, parts of the Upper Palatinate and Kelheim on the Danube. A Braunau Parliament meeting was held in December 1705 in the then-Bavarian Braunau. Long before the French Revolution and early German parliamentarianism the meeting was held on 21 December 1705 in an inn belonging to the Baron von Paumgarten; representatives met of the four estates in Bavaria: aristocracy, clergy, burghers and peasants. The Braunau Parliament  is the name of the congress on the defence of the state of Bavaria held at Braunau am Inn convened on 21 December 1705. Following the initial uprising in November 1705, there was little response from the Austrians for nearly two months. However, that changed following an attempt by the rebels to capture the Bavarian capital, Munich. Following their unsuccessful attack, the night of 25 December 1705 saw an Austrian column encounter the peasant army near Sendling outside of Munich.  The battle was known as Sendling's Night of Murder  or the Sendling Christmas Day Massacre. The insurgents from the Bavarian Oberland were defeated and completely routed by Emperor Joseph I's troops. The number of deaths on the Bavarian side in this battle is estimated at around 1,100 men, but the Austrians lost only about 40.

After the death of her brother InÃ©s and her husband Diego GarcÃ\xada de Herrera became the sole rulers of the islands until 1477 when they ceded La Gomera to their son HernÃ¡n Peraza The Younger and the rights to the conquest of La Palma, Gran Canaria and Tenerife to the King of Castile. The island of La Gomera was not taken in battle but was incorporated into the Peraza-Herrera fiefdom through an agreement between HernÃ¡n Peraza The Elder and some of the insular aboriginal groups who accepted the rule of the Castilian. However, there were a number of uprisings by the guanches due to outrages committed by the rulers on the native Gomeros. The last one, in 1488 caused the death of the islands ruler, HernÃ¡n Peraza, whose widow, Beatriz de Bobadilla y Ossorio, had to seek the assistance of Pedro de Vera, conqueror of Gran Canaria, in order to snuff out the rebellion. The subsequent repression caused the death of two hundred rebels and many others were sold into slavery in the Spanish markets.']",1734,"1488, 1488",0,0.326732149,0.529649241

After Carpenter\'s kickoff was returned from the 29-yard line by Matthew Slater, the Patriots began their first possession at their own 40-yard line. Cassel\'s first two passes were both completed for first downs, putting the Patriots in Dolphins territory and eventually their red zone. However, a holding penalty on Neal pushed the Patriots back 10 yards, forcing a 30-yard Gostkowski field goal four plays later that gave the Patriots a 3-0 lead. Following a Dolphins three-and-out, the Patriots\' second drive ended when a Cassel pass to Moss was bobbled by both Moss and cornerback Jason Allen to keep the ball in the air until Renaldo Hill intercepted it; a 17-yard return gave the Dolphins the ball at the Patriots\' 42-yard line.

A Tedy Bruschi unnecessary roughness penalty on the second Ronnie Brown run set up a first-and-goal, where Camarillo caught a 3-yard pass from Pennington for a touchdown, giving the Dolphins a 7-3 lead. The Patriots responded with a 12-play, 74-yard drive that ended on the first play of the second quarter, an 8-yard touchdown scramble by Cassel to give the Patriots the lead again, 10-7. The Dolphins\' next drive went three-and-out despite two more plays using the ""Wildcat"" formation, giving the Patriots the ball at their own 41-yard line. On a 1-yard Morris run from the Dolphins\' 28-yard line, linebacker Matt Roth forced a fumble during the tackle; the ball was recovered by Dolphins cornerback Andr&#233; Goodman at the Dolphins\' 28-yard line. The Dolphins took advantage of the turnover, going 72 yards on 12 plays and re-taking the lead at 14-10 on a 7-yard Pennington touchdown scramble. Carpenter\'s ensuing kickoff was returned by Slater from the Patriots\' 24-yard line, setting up the Patriots\' next drive to begin from their own 37-yard line. Six plays later, Cassel completed a 25-yard touchdown pass to Moss that gave the Patriots the lead again, 17-14. After an exchange of three-and-outs, the Dolphins began their final drive of the half with 39 seconds remaining and moved into Patriots territory. However, a false start on wide receiver Ted Ginn, Jr. followed by a Vrabel sack of Pennington ended the first half. Due to their deferral of the opening kickoff, the Dolphins elected to receive the opening kickoff of the second half. A 46-yard Pennington pass to Ginn on the first play moved the Dolphins to the Patriots\' 36-yard line; six plays later, Pennington hit fullback Casey Cramer on a 2-yard touchdown catch that gave the Dolphins the lead again at 21-17.

Two plays later, Cassel completed a pass to Welker across the middle; the wide receiver ran along the sideline after the catch to pick up 64 yards on the play. After an incomplete pass to Moss, a 21-yard Faulk touchdown run extended the Patriots\' lead to 31-21 on the final play of the third quarter. Four plays into the Dolphins\' ensuing drive, on 3rd-and-3, Pennington hit wide receiver Davone Bess for a 36-yard gain to put the Dolphins in the Patriots\' red zone. On the next play, a diving Ricky Williams 13-yard touchdown catch cut the Patriots\' lead to 31-28. Facing a 3rd-and-10 from their own 42-yard line during their next drive, the Patriots moved into Dolphins territory on a 23-yard Gaffney catch. Two plays later, Cassel and Moss connected for their third touchdown pass of the day, this one from 29 yards out, to give the Patriots a 38-28 lead. On the next play, Meriweather intercepted a Pennington pass and returned it 19 yards to the Dolphins\' 18-yard line. However, safety Yeremiah Bell sacked Cassel on 3rd-and-2 to set up a 30-yard Gostkowski field goal that extended the Patriots lead to 41-28 with just over seven minutes remaining in the game. Starting from their own 1-yard after a Ginn kick return for a loss and a holding penalty, the Dolphins moved the ball as far as their 44-yard line on 10 plays, but could not successfully convert on fourth down to turn the ball back over to the Patriots. The Patriots, with just four minutes remaining in the game, exclusively ran Green-Ellis running plays on their ensuing possession, moving into the Dolphins\' red zone on back-to-back unnecessary roughness and unsportsmanlike conduct penalties by Porter.

While the Swedish statesmen envisaged the creation of a Trans-Baltic dominion extending northwards to Archangelsk and eastwards to Vologda, De la Gardie and other Swedish soldiers, still holding Novgorod and Ingria, saw the war as a reaction for their forces not receiving payment for their succour during the De la Gardie Campaign. In 1613 they advanced towards Tikhvin and laid a siege to the city, but were repelled. The Russian counter-offensive failed to regain Novgorod, however. The Russian tsar refused to commit his troops to battle and the war lumbered on until 1614, when the Swedes captured Gdov. The following year they laid siege to Pskov but Russian generals Morozov and Buturlin held their own until 27 February 1617, when the Treaty of Stolbovo stripped Russia of its access to the Baltic Sea and awarded to Sweden the province of Ingria with the townships of Ivangorod, Jama, Koporye and Noteborg. Novgorod and Gdov were to be restituted to Russia. As a result of the war, Russia was denied access to the Baltic sea for about a century, despite its persistent efforts to reverse the situation. This led to the increased importance of Arkhangelsk for its trading connections with Western Europe.""]"," The Treaty of Stolbovo awarded Sweden four townships in the province of Ingria: Ivangorod, Jama, Koporye, and Noteborg.","4, 4",1,0.917054928,0.813198773

1. Total households = 149,957
2. Percentage of families (married, with or without children) = 52.70% + 18.30% = 70.70%
   So, total number of families = 149,957 * 0.7070 = approximately 106,636 families

3. Percentage of non-families (single individuals or multiple individuals without any family relationship) = 100% - 70.70% = 29.30%
   So, total number of non-family households = 149,957 * 0.2930 = approximately 44,386 non-family households

4. Total individuals living in family households = (149,957 - 44,386) * 2.13 (average household size for families) = approximately 216,670 individuals
   Since there are two people per family on average, this means that there are about 106,636 families with 2 individuals each, which is the same as our previous calculation of total families.

5. Total individuals living in non-family households = 44,386 * 1 (since these households consist of only one individual) = approximately 44,386 individuals

6. Total number of people in 2000 = Total individuals in family households + Total individuals in non-family households = 216,670 + 44,386 = approximately 260,956 people

7. Since there were 106,636 families and each family has an average of 2.61 members, the total number of people in families is 106,636 * 2.61 = approximately 274,889 people.

8. Therefore, there are fewer families than people because the total number of people (260,956) is less than the total number of people in families (274,889). The difference is about 13,933 people.","35500, 35500",0,1,0.285214545

In 2011, the percentage of people who identified as two or more races was 2.9%, while the combined percentage of Asian American and African American was 1.6% (1.6% Asian + 0.9% black or African American).

In 2000, the percentage of people who identified as two or more races was 2.18%, while the combined percentage of Asian American and African American was 2.17% (1.45% Asian + 0.33% black or African American).

To find the difference in percentages between these groups, we subtract the 2000 percentage from the 2011 percentage for each group:

Difference in percentage for two or more races = (2.9 - 2.18) * 100% = 36.4% increase
Difference in percentage for Asian American and African American = (1.6 - 2.17) * 100% = -25.6% decrease

Since we are interested in the difference between people identifying as two or more races compared to those solely Asian or African American, we take the absolute value of the differences:

When was the Republic proclaimed?,"[""The 5 October 1910 revolution was the overthrow of the centuries-old Portuguese Monarchy and its replacement by the Portuguese Republic. It was the result of a coup d'Ã©tat organized by the Portuguese Republican Party. By 1910, the Kingdom of Portugal was in deep crisis: British pressure on Portugal's colonies, the royal family's expenses, the assassination of the King and his heir in 1908, changing religious and social views, instability of the two political parties , the dictatorship of JoÃ£o Franco, and the regime's apparent inability to adapt to modern times all led to widespread resentment against the Monarchy. The proponents of the republic, particularly the Republican Party, found ways to take advantage of the situation. The Republican Party presented itself as the only one that had a programme that was capable of returning to the country its lost status and place Portugal on the way of progress. After a reluctance of the military to combat the nearly two thousand soldiers and sailors that rebelled between 3 and 4 October 1910, the Republic was proclaimed at 9 o'clock of the next day from the balcony of the PaÃ§os do Concelho in Lisbon. After the revolution, a provisional government led by TeÃ³filo Braga directed the fate of the country until the approval of the Constitution in 1911 that marked the beginning of the First Republic.

This is because the under-18 group includes all ages up to and including 4 years old (since 5-year-olds are also included in this group). To find out how many of these people are actually less than 5 years old, we can calculate the percentage of the under-18 population that is less than 5:

Since the under-5 age group includes children from birth to 4 years old, and there are 4 years between ages 0 and 5, we can find out how many 0-4 year-olds are in the under-18 group by dividing the number of people under 18 by 4:

Number of people under 5 = Number of people under 18 / 4
                         = 5,841 / 4
                         = 1,460.25 (approximately)

Since we cannot have a fraction of a person, let's round this to the nearest whole number:

Number of people under 5 ≈ 1,460

Now, to find out what percentage of the total population this represents, we can divide the number of people under 5 by the total population and multiply by 100:

Percentage of population under 5 = (Number of people under 5 / Total population) * 100
                              ≈ (1,460 / 5,841) * 100
                              ≈ 25.3%

Throughout the 1740s, the Hanthawaddy forces were winning against Upper Burma-based Toungoo armies.

How many times did Ava experience rebellion from Toungoo lords?,"[""After the end of Forty Years' War in 1424, Ava gave up its dream of rebuilding the Pagan Empire. Instead, for the next six decades, it would struggle to hold on to its vassal states. Rebellions arose every time a new king came to power. The new king would have to reestablish his power all over again by gaining the fealty of all the vassal states, usually by show of force. Of these, the remote vassal state of Toungoo , tucked away in the southeastern corner across the Pegu Yoma range, proved most troublesome to successive kings at Ava. Toungoo lords rebelled against Ava in 1426-1440, 1451-1459 and 1468-1470, usually with Pegu's implicit or explicit support. Ava also faced rebellions at Mohnyin  and Prome . The beginning of the end of Ava came in 1480. The new king Minkhaung II was greeted with a multitude of rebellions but it proved to be different this time. The most serious rebellion was by his younger brother, lord of Yamethin. With a serious rebellion so close to Ava, vassal states broke away one by one. The Yamethin rebellion went on until 1500.

What caused the value of the crown to decrease?,"[""The Czech lands were among the first industrialized countries in continental Europe during the German Confederation era. The Czech industrial tradition dates back to the 19th century, when the Lands of the Bohemian Crown were the economic and industrial heartland of the Austrian Empire and later the Austrian side of Austria-Hungary. The Czech lands produced a majority  of all industrial goods in the Empire, some of which were almost monopolistic. The Czechoslovak crown was introduced in April 1919. Introduced at a 1:1 ratio to the Austro-Hungarian currency, it became one of the most stable currencies in Europe. The First Republic became one of the 10 most developed countries of the world . The consequences of the 1938 Munich Agreement and subsequent occupation were disastrous for the economy. After the occupation and forced subordination of the economy to German economic interests, the crown was officially pegged to the mark at a ratio of 1:10, even though the unofficial exchange rate was 1 to 6-7 and Germans immediately started buying Czech goods in large quantities. In accordance with Stalin's development policy of planned interdependence, all the economies of the socialist countries were tightly linked to that of the Soviet Union. Czechoslovakia was the most prosperous country in the Eastern Bloc, however it continued to lag further behind the rest of the developed world. With the disintegration of the communist economic alliance in 1991, Czech manufacturers lost their traditional markets among former communist countries in the east. Today, this heritage is both an asset and a liability. The Czech Republic has a well-educated population and a well-developed infrastructure.""]"," The value of the crown (assuming you meant the currency) did not decrease as Bulgaria's official currency is the Bulgarian lev (BGN). The factors that caused an increase in Bulgaria's state debt, which indirectly affected its economy and the value of the lev, were the Financial crisis of 2007-08, deficit spending policies implemented after the crisis, and the collapse of Corporate Commercial Bank in 2014. These events led to an increase in Bulgaria's state debt, which rose from a record low of 0.784 billion euro in 2008 to 7.219 billion euro by the end of 2013 and further to 26.7% of GDP in 2015.

By how many games were the Saints trailing the series with the Bears?,"[' During the eighth week of the season, the Bears went to the Mercedes-Benz Superdome to play the New Orleans Saints, who trailed the series 15-14 but had won every meeting since 2011. Jeff Joniak wrote a goal of the Bears offense would be to get into scoring position; since Mitchell Trubisky became the starter, the offense had entered the red zone only twice in three games, with both trips ending in field goals. Upon reaching the 20-yard line, using the running game would be ideal; Jordan Howard ranked fifth in the league in rushing, second in yards after contact, and led the offense rushing first downs with 32. In contrast, the Saints defense ranked 30th in rushing yards allowed per carry. Joniak also emphasized the need for Trubisky to tune out the loud Superdome crowd and lead the offense without making errors. For the defense, it faced Drew Brees, who, according to Joniak, was to be pressured quickly if the Bears were to succeed - while being blitzed, Brees was intercepted three times and sacked twice. Otherwise, Brees was successful in quickly passing the ball for gains of six yards in a fast-paced offense. Turnovers were also priority; in the last two games, the Bears had forced six and scored on three, and while Brees had recorded turnovers in his last two games, the Saints still had the fifth-best turnover difference. On the Saints\' opening possession, Will Lutz was lining up for a 32-yard field goal attempt when Kyle Fuller was penalized for jumping offsides. This set up Alvin Kamara\'s eight-yard touchdown run to put New Orleans up by seven points. After the next two drives resulted in punts, Connor Barth made a 27-yard field goal in the second quarter, though Mark Ingram Jr. scored on a one-yard touchdown run. Barth missed a 48-yard field goal wide left late in the first half as the Bears entered halftime with an 11-point deficit. In the third quarter, Trubisky threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to Zach Miller, who landed on his knee and dislocated it in the process. The touchdown was eventually nullified when referee Carl Cheffers determined Miller had let go of the ball in pain while on the ground. The Bears were forced to settle for Barth\'s 44-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, Lutz kicked a 45-yard field goal to increase the lead to 17-6. With 7:32 remaining in the game, Jonathan Bullard stripped Ingram and Christian Jones recovered the fumble. Aided by Trubisky\'s 46-yard run, Tarik Cohen dove into the end zone from the Saints\' one-yard line to score the offense\'s first touchdown in 25 series (dating back to the Baltimore game). The Bears failed to score on the two-point conversion but were just five points down. Chicago forced another takeaway when Adrian Amos stripped and recovered the ball from Ingram with 2:12 left. Although the Bears turned the ball over on downs, they had another chance after Lutz\'s 49-yard field goal put them behind by eight points. However, Trubisky\'s pass for Tre McBride was intercepted by Marshon Lattimore to seal the loss. Miller was taken to the University Medical Center New Orleans for treatment. In addition to a dislocated knee, Miller was revealed to have torn the popliteal artery in his region, an injury that is common in car accidents and raised the possibility of amputation. Vascular surgery was successfully completed the day after the game. The overturning of Miller\'s catch was controversial. Cheffers defended the call, stating when Miller was falling to the turf, he ""has to survive the ground. He went to the ground, he temporarily lost control of the ball. The ball hit the ground; therefore it\'s incomplete."" The NFL\'s Vice President of Officiating Alberto Riveron also maintained Miller had not completed the catch, but predecessors Mike Pereira and Dean Blandino argued otherwise. ""At some point the process of the catch ends, and it ends when he rolls over on the ground with control. It was ruled a catch on the field. I didn\'t see anything definitive to overturn it and quite frankly, if it had been ruled incomplete on the field, if it had been me in the command center, I would have reversed it to a catch,"" Blandino said.

In these elections, 26 mandatory delegates were proposed by the Bolshevik Central Committee and 58 were proposed by the Socialist Revolutionaries.

The outcome of the election gave the majority to the Socialist Revolutionary Party, which no longer existed as a full party by that time, as the Left SR Party was in coalition with the Bolsheviks. The Bolsheviks dissolved the Constituent Assembly in January 1918, when it came into conflict with the Soviets.

In 2011, there were 88,112 residents, and 2.9% of them identified as being from two or more races. So, that's 2543 people (88,112 * 0.029).

For the combined group of Native Americans and Asians in 2011, there were 0.9% Native American and 1.6% Asian residents. So, that's 798 people (0.9% of 88,112) for Native Americans and 1405 people (1.6% of 88,112) for Asians.

The total number of people from these two groups is 2203 people (798 + 1405).

Now, let's find the difference between the number of people who identified as being from two or more races and the combined number of Native Americans and Asians:

Difference = Number of people from two or more races - Combined number of Native Americans and Asians
           = 2543 - 2203
           = 340

To express this difference as a percentage, we divide the difference by the total population (88,112) and multiply by 100:

Percentage difference = (Difference / Total population) * 100
                    = (340 / 88,112) * 100

What state helped to foment Tougoo rebellion,"[""After the end of Forty Years' War in 1424, Ava gave up its dream of rebuilding the Pagan Empire.

1. Calculate the total number of people in households:
   - Households with children under 18: 74,285 * 29.5% = 21,922 households * average household size (2.55) = 55,063.6 + rounding up to 55,064 people
   - Households without children under 18: 74,285 - 21,922 = 52,363 households * average household size (2.55) = 132,188.4 + rounding up to 132,189 people
   - Total people in households: 55,064 + 132,189 = 187,253 people

2. Add any additional individuals not living in households:
   - Individuals living alone: 6,527
   - People in POSSLQ: 4,386
   - Same-sex partnerships: 504
   - Total additional people: 6,527 + 4,386 + 504 = 11,417 people

3. Calculate the total number of people reported according to the census:
   - Total people in households + Additional individuals not living in households: 187,253 + 11,417 = 198,670 people

Since we started with the number of households (74,285), and now we have the total number of people reported according to the census (198,670), the difference represents how many more people than households are reported:

By how many points did the Bears win against the Raiders in 2003 at Soldier Field?,"["" Returning to Soldier Field for week four, the Bears hosted the Oakland Raiders, who held a 7-6 all-time lead entering the game. This was the first game between the two at Soldier Field since 2003, where the Bears won 24-21, and the first since 2011, when the Raiders won 25-20 in Oakland. The Bears offense faced a defense led by defensive end Khalil Mack, while the secondary is guided by 39-year old Charles Woodson, who possessed 61 career interceptions, and had sealed the Raiders' win the previous week against the Browns. However, the Raiders had struggled against tight ends, allowing five catches of at least 25 yards, with a total of 20 catches for 298 yards and five touchdowns across the first three games. On defense, Chicago was against quarterback Derek Carr, who led the Raiders offense to 74 combined points in the last two games, along with rookie receiver Amari Cooper, who had 20 receptions entering the game, while also recording a 68-yard touchdown in week two. Jeff Joniak wrote that the Bears had to prevent the Raiders from gaining yardage after touching the ball; the Raiders were seventh in yards after the catch, while Latavius Murray - who had recorded 139 rushing yards in week three, was ranked fourth in the league in rushing yards and was leading the AFC in yards per carry with 4.8 - ranked fifth in yards after contact. Cooper had 177 yards after the catch, the second-most in the league among wide receivers, while 53.7 percent of Carr's passing yards occurred due to these plays. In comparison, the Bears allowed the fewest yards after contact. David Fales, punter Patrick O'Donnell, Alshon Jeffery, Ka'Deem Carey, Hroniss Grasu, tackle Jermon Bushrod and nose tackle Jeremiah Ratliff were inactive. The Raiders won the coin toss and deferred in the second half. The Bears managed to record an 80-yard drive to score on the opening possession via Jay Cutler's seven-yard touchdown pass to Eddie Royal. During the drive, lineman Charles Leno landed on center Will Montgomery's leg, injuring the latter and prompting Matt Slauson to replace him. Robbie Gould's extra point was blocked, and his struggles continued with the following kickoff when his squib kick bounced out of bounds. After the game's four next drives culminated with punts, the Raiders scored on Carr's 26-yard touchdown pass to Cooper; despite initially being ruled out of bounds, the Raiders challenged the call and the ruling was overturned. On the Bears' next series, Slauson botched the snap to Cutler, and the Raiders' Dan Williams recovered. Oakland capitalized on the takeaway with Roy Helu scoring on a four-yard touchdown reception, though the Bears responded with Cutler taking advantage of an open Martellus Bennett to score on a five-yard touchdown. On Oakland's next drive, Carr's swing pass to Murray was deflected and landed towards Pernell McPhee, intercepting the pass; Gould eventually kicked a 19-yard field goal. In the second half, the Raiders punted on the first drive, though they reclaimed the ball after Stacy McGee recovered Matt Forte's fumble. Oakland eventually took the lead with Sebastian Janikowski's 29-yard field goal. Gould eventually gave the Bears the lead back with Gould's 54-yard kick, and reclaimed possession of the ball with Murray dropping a pitch and Sam Acho recovered. However, the Bears gave the ball back when Cutler's pass for Bennett fell short and was intercepted by Woodson, leading to Janikowski's 41-yard field goal. With 2:05 left in the game, Cutler began leading a two-minute drill: after a six-yard run by Forte, followed by a sack by Mack and incomplete pass to Josh Bellamy to bring up fourth down, Cutler successfully converted with a seven-yard pass to Bennett, who beat Keenan Lambert. Cutler's next pass to Marquess Wilson fell incomplete, and Forte's seven-yard run led to another third-down situation, which led to Cutler's first-down conversion of seven yards to Wilson with 56 seconds left. On the next set of downs, Cutler's pass for receiver Cameron Meredith was overthrown, though a 12-yard pass to Royal allowed the offense to enter Oakland territory, where the Bears elected to use a timeout with 40 seconds remaining. The offense entered field goal range with Cutler's nine-yard pass to Wilson, followed by a two-yard run by Forte. With seven seconds left, the Bears used another timeout, and allowed Gould to attempt the 49-yard field goal; Gould successfully converted the field goal with two seconds remaining on the clock to give the Bears the 22-20 lead. In an last-second attempt to score, the Raiders attempted lateral passes on the kickoff return, but were penalized for an illegal lateral in the early stages of the play, and the Bears eventually recovered to clinch the win. Gould was later named the NFC Special Teams Player of the Week, his third ST POTW honor and tying him with kickers Jeff Jaeger and Paul Edinger for the most in team history. The field goal was Gould's eleventh career game-winner. Forte ran for 91 yards in the game to increase his career rushing yards total to 8,071, becoming the 14th player in NFL history to record 8,000 and 3,500 career rushing and receiving yards, respectively, while becoming the second-fastest player to achieve the milestone with 111 games.

restored reformed church ministers serve its members in how many congregations,"[""The Dutch Reformed Church remained the largest church body in the Netherlands until the middle of the 20th century, when it was overtaken by the Roman Catholic Church. The rapid secularisation of the Netherlands in the 1960s dramatically reduced participation in the mainstream Protestant church. From the '60s onward, a number of attempts were made to effect a reunion with the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands . This led to the two churches uniting with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Kingdom of the Netherlands  to establish the Protestant Church in the Netherlands in 2004. The 2004 merger led to a separation in which a number of congregations and members of the Dutch Reformed Church separated to form the Restored Reformed Church . Estimations of their membership vary from 35,000 up to 70,000 in about 120 local congregations served by 88 ministers. The Restored Reformed Church disapproves of the pluralistic nature of the merged church, which they allege contains partly contradicting Reformed and Lutheran confessions. This conservative group also opposes the ordination of women and the blessing of same-sex unions in Christian churches, which have been adopted as practices by the merged church.""]", The Restored Reformed Church serves its members in approximately 120 local congregations.,"120, 120, 120, 120, 120, 120",1,0.619995101,0.775206478
How many points in total were scored?,"["" Returning to Soldier Field for week four, the Bears hosted the Oakland Raiders, who held a 7-6 all-time lead entering the game. This was the first game between the two at Soldier Field since 2003, where the Bears won 24-21, and the first since 2011, when the Raiders won 25-20 in Oakland. The Bears offense faced a defense led by defensive end Khalil Mack, while the secondary is guided by 39-year old Charles Woodson, who possessed 61 career interceptions, and had sealed the Raiders' win the previous week against the Browns. However, the Raiders had struggled against tight ends, allowing five catches of at least 25 yards, with a total of 20 catches for 298 yards and five touchdowns across the first three games. On defense, Chicago was against quarterback Derek Carr, who led the Raiders offense to 74 combined points in the last two games, along with rookie receiver Amari Cooper, who had 20 receptions entering the game, while also recording a 68-yard touchdown in week two. Jeff Joniak wrote that the Bears had to prevent the Raiders from gaining yardage after touching the ball; the Raiders were seventh in yards after the catch, while Latavius Murray - who had recorded 139 rushing yards in week three, was ranked fourth in the league in rushing yards and was leading the AFC in yards per carry with 4.8 - ranked fifth in yards after contact. Cooper had 177 yards after the catch, the second-most in the league among wide receivers, while 53.7 percent of Carr's passing yards occurred due to these plays. In comparison, the Bears allowed the fewest yards after contact. David Fales, punter Patrick O'Donnell, Alshon Jeffery, Ka'Deem Carey, Hroniss Grasu, tackle Jermon Bushrod and nose tackle Jeremiah Ratliff were inactive. The Raiders won the coin toss and deferred in the second half. The Bears managed to record an 80-yard drive to score on the opening possession via Jay Cutler's seven-yard touchdown pass to Eddie Royal. During the drive, lineman Charles Leno landed on center Will Montgomery's leg, injuring the latter and prompting Matt Slauson to replace him. Robbie Gould's extra point was blocked, and his struggles continued with the following kickoff when his squib kick bounced out of bounds. After the game's four next drives culminated with punts, the Raiders scored on Carr's 26-yard touchdown pass to Cooper; despite initially being ruled out of bounds, the Raiders challenged the call and the ruling was overturned. On the Bears' next series, Slauson botched the snap to Cutler, and the Raiders' Dan Williams recovered. Oakland capitalized on the takeaway with Roy Helu scoring on a four-yard touchdown reception, though the Bears responded with Cutler taking advantage of an open Martellus Bennett to score on a five-yard touchdown. On Oakland's next drive, Carr's swing pass to Murray was deflected and landed towards Pernell McPhee, intercepting the pass; Gould eventually kicked a 19-yard field goal. In the second half, the Raiders punted on the first drive, though they reclaimed the ball after Stacy McGee recovered Matt Forte's fumble. Oakland eventually took the lead with Sebastian Janikowski's 29-yard field goal. Gould eventually gave the Bears the lead back with Gould's 54-yard kick, and reclaimed possession of the ball with Murray dropping a pitch and Sam Acho recovered. However, the Bears gave the ball back when Cutler's pass for Bennett fell short and was intercepted by Woodson, leading to Janikowski's 41-yard field goal. With 2:05 left in the game, Cutler began leading a two-minute drill: after a six-yard run by Forte, followed by a sack by Mack and incomplete pass to Josh Bellamy to bring up fourth down, Cutler successfully converted with a seven-yard pass to Bennett, who beat Keenan Lambert. Cutler's next pass to Marquess Wilson fell incomplete, and Forte's seven-yard run led to another third-down situation, which led to Cutler's first-down conversion of seven yards to Wilson with 56 seconds left. On the next set of downs, Cutler's pass for receiver Cameron Meredith was overthrown, though a 12-yard pass to Royal allowed the offense to enter Oakland territory, where the Bears elected to use a timeout with 40 seconds remaining. The offense entered field goal range with Cutler's nine-yard pass to Wilson, followed by a two-yard run by Forte. With seven seconds left, the Bears used another timeout, and allowed Gould to attempt the 49-yard field goal; Gould successfully converted the field goal with two seconds remaining on the clock to give the Bears the 22-20 lead. In an last-second attempt to score, the Raiders attempted lateral passes on the kickoff return, but were penalized for an illegal lateral in the early stages of the play, and the Bears eventually recovered to clinch the win. Gould was later named the NFC Special Teams Player of the Week, his third ST POTW honor and tying him with kickers Jeff Jaeger and Paul Edinger for the most in team history. The field goal was Gould's eleventh career game-winner. Forte ran for 91 yards in the game to increase his career rushing yards total to 8,071, becoming the 14th player in NFL history to record 8,000 and 3,500 career rushing and receiving yards, respectively, while becoming the second-fastest player to achieve the milestone with 111 games. The win would be the only home win for the Bears all season, finishing the year with a horrific 1-7 home record.

Which team got the ball first?,"[' Looking to avoid back-to-back divisional losses, the Patriots traveled to Miami to face the 6-4 Dolphins at Dolphin Stadium.

Who controlled West Hungary?,"['The Siege of Vienna in 1529 was the first attempt by the Ottoman Empire, led by Suleiman the Magnificent, to capture the city of Vienna, Austria. The siege signalled the pinnacle of the Ottoman Empire\'s power and the maximum extent of Ottoman expansion in central Europe. Thereafter, 150 years of bitter military tension and reciprocal attacks ensued, culminating in the Battle of Vienna of 1683, which marked the start of the 15-year-long Great Turkish War. The inability of the Ottomans to capture Vienna in 1529 turned the tide against almost a century of conquest throughout eastern and central Europe. The Ottoman Empire had previously annexed Central Hungary and established a vassal state in Transylvania in the wake of the Battle of MohÃ¡cs. According to Arnold J. Toynbee, ""The failure of the first  brought to a standstill the tide of Ottoman conquest which had been flooding up the Danube Valley for a century past."" There is speculation by some historians that Suleiman\'s main objective in 1529 was actually to assert Ottoman control over the whole of Hungary, the western part of which  was under Habsburg control. The decision to attack Vienna after such a long interval in Suleiman\'s European campaign is viewed as an opportunistic manoeuvre after his decisive victory in Hungary. Other scholars theorise that the suppression of Hungary simply marked the prologue to a later, premeditated invasion of Europe.']"," From 1920 to 1944 (with some exceptions), West Hungary was controlled by the Kingdom of Hungary under Regent Miklós Horthy.

Since the total migrants make up about 55% of Bahrain's population, we can find the total population of Bahrain by dividing the total number of migrants by 0.55:

Total Population = Total Migrants / 0.55 ≈ 932,727 (rounded)

Now let's assume that the remaining migrants are evenly distributed among all other countries/states. To find the number of migrants from other parts of the state, we can subtract the total number of migrants provided in your context from the total population:

Migrants from Other Parts of the State = Total Population - Total Migrants = 932,727 - 513,000 ≈ 419,727 (rounded)

To find the percentage of these migrants compared to the total number of migrants provided in your context, we can divide the number of migrants from other parts of the state by the total number of migrants and multiply by 100:

Percentage = (Migrants from Other Parts of the State / Total Migrants) * 100
                  ≈ (419,727 / 513,000) * 100 ≈ 81.8% (rounded)

So, approximately 81.8% of the remaining migrants are from other parts of the state. Keep in mind that this is an estimation based on the assumption that the remaining migrants are evenly distributed among all other countries/states. The actual percentage could be different depending on the distribution of migrants from other regions.","27.7, 33.8",0.111111111,0.752203299,0.276607232

The Czech industrial tradition dates back to the 19th century, when the Lands of the Bohemian Crown were the economic and industrial heartland of the Austrian Empire and later the Austrian side of Austria-Hungary. The Czech lands produced a majority  of all industrial goods in the Empire, some of which were almost monopolistic. The Czechoslovak crown was introduced in April 1919. Introduced at a 1:1 ratio to the Austro-Hungarian currency, it became one of the most stable currencies in Europe. The First Republic became one of the 10 most developed countries of the world . The consequences of the 1938 Munich Agreement and subsequent occupation were disastrous for the economy. After the occupation and forced subordination of the economy to German economic interests, the crown was officially pegged to the mark at a ratio of 1:10, even though the unofficial exchange rate was 1 to 6-7 and Germans immediately started buying Czech goods in large quantities. In accordance with Stalin's development policy of planned interdependence, all the economies of the socialist countries were tightly linked to that of the Soviet Union. Czechoslovakia was the most prosperous country in the Eastern Bloc, however it continued to lag further behind the rest of the developed world. With the disintegration of the communist economic alliance in 1991, Czech manufacturers lost their traditional markets among former communist countries in the east.

In September 1974, Emperor Haile Selassie had been overthrown by the Derg , marking a period of turmoil. The Derg quickly fell into internal conflict to determine who would have primacy.

One of the separatist groups seeking to take advantage of the chaos was the pro-Somalia Western Somali Liberation Front  operating in the Somali-inhabited Ogaden area, which by late 1975 had struck numerous government outposts. From 1976 to 1977, Somalia supplied arms and other aid to the WSLF. A sign that order had been restored among the Derg was the announcement of Mengistu Haile Mariam as head of state on February 11, 1977. However, the country remained in chaos as the military attempted to suppress its civilian opponents in a period known as the Red Terror . Despite the violence, the Soviet Union, which had been closely observing developments, came to believe that Ethiopia was developing into a genuine Marxist-Leninist state and that it was in Soviet interests to aid the new regime. They thus secretly approached Mengistu with offers of aid that he accepted. Ethiopia closed the U.S. military mission and the communications centre in April 1977.

Did Charles V die before or after Edward III?,"[""With his health continuing to deteriorate, the Black Prince returned to England in January 1371, whereby now his father Edward III was elderly and also in poor health. The prince's illness was debilitating, and he died on 8 June 1376. Edward III died the following year on 21 June 1377; he was succeeded by the Black Prince's second son Richard II , who was still a child. The treaty at BrÃ©tigny left Edward III and England with enlarged holdings in France; however, a small professional French army under the leadership of du Guesclin pushed the English back and, by the time of Charles V's death in 1380, the English only held Calais and a few other coastal cities. It was usual to appoint a regent in the case of a child monarch, but no regent was appointed for Richard II, who nominally exercised the power of kingship from the date of his accession in 1377. However, between 1377 and 1380, actual power was in the hands of a series of councils. The political community preferred this to a regency led by the king's uncle, John of Gaunt, although Gaunt remained highly influential. Richard faced many challenges during his reign, including the Peasants' Revolt led by Wat Tyler in 1381 and an Anglo-Scottish war in 1384-1385. His attempts to raise taxes to pay for his Scottish adventure and for the protection of Calais against the French made him increasingly unpopular.""]"," Charles V died before Edward III, as Charles V passed away in 1380, while Edward III died in 1377.",after,1,0.782439925,0.394921446

In 1598, Boris Godunov was crowned to the Russian throne, marking the end of the centuries long rule of the Rurik dynasty.

While Godunov managed to put the opposition to his rule under control, he did not manage to crush it completely. To add to his troubles, the first years of the 17th century were exceptionally cold.

Percentage of mineral products exports = (Percentage of mineral products in total exports) * 100%
                                                       = (96.3%) * 100%

Total imports = 2.88 billion US dollars

Now, let's assume the remaining percentage of imports comes from other sources (other than mineral products). We can calculate this as follows:

Percentage of other imports = 100% - Percentage of mineral products imports
                                          = 100% - 26.6% (from Metropolitan France) - 13.6% (from Singapore) - 10.7% (from Australia) - 4.0% (from New Zealand) - 3.2% (from the United States) - 3.0% (from China) - 3.0% (from Japan)
                                          = 50.9% (other countries)

Now, we can compare the percentage of mineral products exports and other imports to find out how many more percent mineral products were than imports:

Difference in Percentage = Percentage of mineral products exports - Percentage of other imports
                                         = 96.3% - 50.9%

6. Households with someone aged 65 or older: 149,957 * 0.169 = 25,788.63 (rounding to 25,789)

Little is known about his childhood. Around 1549-1550 he briefly visited Italy and probably spent a few months attending lectures at the Padua University. Upon his return, he joined the army of Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor, and took part in his military struggle against the Turks.

How many more games did Houston play from the end of May to the end of July than they played up to the end of May?,"['In 2005, the Astros started poorly and found themselves with a 15â€“30 record in late May. The Houston Chronicle had written them off with a tombstone emblazoned with ""RIP 2005 Astros"". However, from that low point until the end of July, Houston went 42â€“17 and found themselves in the lead for an NL wild card spot. July saw the best single-month record in the clubs history at 22-7. Offensive production had increased greatly after a slow start in the first two months.  The Astros had also developed an excellent pitching staff, anchored by Roy Oswalt (20â€“12, 2.94), Andy Pettitte (17â€“9, 2.39), and Roger Clemens (13â€“8 with a league-low ERA of only 1.87).

The Astros won a wild card berth on the final day of the regular season, becoming the first team since the world champion 1914 Boston Braves to qualify for the postseason after being 15 games under .500.']"," To find out how many more games Houston played from the end of May to the end of July, we need to know the total number of games they played in those two periods and subtract the number of games they played up to the end of May.

1. From the context, it seems that the Astros' season started in April, but we don't have specific dates for when their season ended in 2005. However, let's assume a standard MLB season with 162 games.

2. Up to the end of May, Houston played 80 games (since they had a 15-30 record by late May).

3. From the end of May to the end of July, there are 72 days in those two months (assuming 30 days for June and 31 days for July), and each day has one game. So, Houston played 72 games from the end of May to the end of July.

4. To find out how many more games they played during this period compared to up to the end of May, we subtract the number of games played up to the end of May: 72 - 80 = -8 (negative 8 means they played 8 fewer games from the end of May to the end of July than they did up to the end of May).

However, it seems there might be a mistake in the question as Houston improved significantly during this period and not played fewer games. It's possible that the number of days or the assumption about the season length is incorrect.",14,0.3125,0,0.043059314
