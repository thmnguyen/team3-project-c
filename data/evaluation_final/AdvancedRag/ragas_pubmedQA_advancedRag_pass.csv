Is ganglionated plexi ablation during Maze IV procedure beneficial for postoperative long-term stable sinus rhythm?,"['We investigated the role of surgical ablation targeting the autonomous nervous system during a Cox-Maze IV procedure in the maintenance of sinus rhythm at long-term follow-up.\nThe patient population consisted of 519 subjects with persistent or long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) undergoing radiofrequency Maze IV during open heart surgery between January 2006 and July 2013 at three institutions without (Group 1) or with (Group 2) ganglionated plexi (GP) ablation. Recurrence of atrial fibrillation off-antiarrhythmic drugs was the primary outcome. Predictors of AF recurrence were evaluated by means of competing risk regression. Median follow-up was 36.7 months.\nThe percentage of patients in normal sinus rhythm (NSR) off-antiarrhythmic drugs did not differ between groups (Group 1-75.5%, Group 2-67.8%, p = 0.08). Duration of AF â‰¥ 38 months (p = 0.01), left atrial diameter â‰¥ 54 mm (0.001), left atrial area â‰¥ 33 cm(2) (p = 0.005), absence of connecting lesions (p= 0.04), and absence of right atrial ablation (p<0.001) were independently associated with high incidence of AF recurrence. In contrast the absence of GP ablation was not a significant factor (p = 0.12).']"," The study suggests that ganglionated plexi ablation during the Maze IV procedure does not significantly affect the maintenance of sinus rhythm at long-term follow-up in patients with persistent or long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation (AF). Other factors such as duration of AF, left atrial diameter and area, absence of connecting lesions, and absence of right atrial ablation were found to be independently associated with a high incidence of AF recurrence. However, the absence of ganglionated plexi ablation was not a significant factor in this study.",No. GP ablation did not prove to be beneficial for postoperative stable NSR. A complete left atrial lesion set and biatrial ablation are advisable for improving rhythm outcomes. Randomized controlled trials are necessary to confirm our findings.,1,0,0.366330767
Production of chemokines by perivascular adipose tissue: a role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis?,"['Obesity is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Although it is known that white adipose tissue (WAT) produces numerous proinflammatory and proatherogenic cytokines and chemokines, it is unclear whether adipose-derived chemotactic signals affect the chronic inflammation in atherosclerosis.\nHistological examination showed that perivascular WAT (pWAT) is in close proximity to vascular walls, particularly at sites that have a tendency to develop atherosclerosis. In rodents, the amount of pWAT is markedly increased by a high-fat diet. At a functional level, supernatant from subcutaneous and pWAT strongly induced the chemotaxis of peripheral blood leukocytes. The migration of granulocytes and monocytes was mostly mediated by interleukin-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, respectively, whereas both chemokines contributed to the migration of activated T cells. Moreover, pWAT produces these chemokines, as shown by immunohistochemistry and by explant culture. The accumulation of macrophages and T cells at the interface between pWAT and the adventitia of human atherosclerotic aortas may reflect this prochemotactic activity of pWAT.']"," Yes, perivascular adipose tissue (pWAT) appears to play a role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis by producing chemokines that attract immune cells such as granulocytes, monocytes, and activated T cells towards the vascular walls. These chemotactic signals are primarily mediated by interleukin-8 (IL-8) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), which contribute to chronic inflammation in atherosclerosis. The increased amount of pWAT observed in rodents on a high-fat diet may exacerbate this process, potentially contributing to the increased risk for cardiovascular disease associated with obesity.","Yes. Human pWAT has chemotactic properties through the secretion of different chemokines, and we propose that pWAT might contribute to the progression of obesity-associated atherosclerosis.",1,0.75995287,0.566048388
Is a 9-month treatment sufficient in tuberculous enterocolitis?,"['Tuberculosis has increased in parallel with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome epidemic and the use of immunosuppressive therapy, and the growing incidence of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis, especially with intestinal involvement, reflects this trend. However, the duration of anti-tuberculous therapy has not been clarified in intestinal tuberculosis.AIM: To compare the efficacy of different treatment durations in tuberculous enterocolitis in terms of response and recurrence rates.\nForty patients with tuberculous enterocolitis were randomized prospectively: 22 patients into a 9-month and 18 into a 15-month group. Diagnosis was made either by colonoscopic findings of discrete ulcers and histopathological findings of caseating granuloma and/or acid-fast bacilli, or by clinical improvement after therapeutic trial. Patients were followed up with colonoscopy every other month until complete response or treatment completion, and then every 6 months for 1 year and annually. Complete response was defined as a resolution of symptoms and active tuberculosis by colonoscopy.\nComplete response was obtained in all patients in both groups. Two patients in the 9-month group and one in the 15-month group underwent operation due to intestinal obstruction and perianal fistula, respectively. No recurrence of active intestinal tuberculosis occurred during the follow-up period in either group.']"," Based on the information provided, it appears that both 9-month and 15-month treatments were effective in achieving complete response in patients with tuberculous enterocolitis, as no active intestinal tuberculosis recurred during the follow-up period in either group. However, it's important to note that two patients in the 9-month group required surgery due to intestinal obstruction and perianal fistula, while only one patient in the 15-month group did. This suggests that a longer treatment duration might reduce the risk of complications requiring surgical intervention. However, more research is needed to confirm this finding and to determine the optimal treatment duration for tuberculous enterocolitis.",Yes. Tuberculous enterocolitis can be managed by 9-month chemotherapy without disease recurrence. Further investigations are needed in immunocompromised patients.,0.833333333,0.897627962,0.577495345
A patient with myelomeningocele: is untethering necessary prior to scoliosis correction?,"[""Tethering of the spinal cord is thought to increase the chance of neurological injury when scoliosis correction is undertaken. All patients with myelomeningocele (MM) are radiographically tethered, and untethering procedures carry significant morbidity risks including worsening neurological function and wound complications. No guidelines exist as regards untethering in patients with MM prior to scoliosis correction surgery. The authors' aim in this study was to evaluate their experience in patients with MM who were not untethered before scoliosis correction.\nSeventeen patients with MM were retrospectively identified and 1) had no evidence of a clinically symptomatic tethered cord, 2) had undergone spinal fusion for scoliosis correction, and 3) had not been untethered for at least 1 year prior to surgery. The minimum follow-up after fusion was 2 years. Charts and radiographs were reviewed for neurological or shunt complications in the perioperative period.\nThe average age of the patients was 12.4 years, and the following neurological levels were affected: T-12 and above, 7 patients; L-1/L-2, 6 patients; L-3, 2 patients; and L-4, 2 patients. All were radiographically tethered as confirmed on MR imaging. Fourteen of the patients (82%) had a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. The mean Cobb angle was corrected from 82 degrees to 35 degrees , for a 57% correction. All patients underwent neuromonitoring of their upper extremities, and some underwent lower extremity monitoring as well. Postoperatively, no patient experienced a new cranial nerve palsy, shunt malfunction, change in urological function, or upper extremity weakness/sensory loss. One patient had transient lower extremity weakness, which returned to baseline within 1 month of surgery.""]"," Based on the information provided, it appears that the study suggests that scoliosis correction can be performed in patients with myelomeningocele (MM) without prior untethering, and the results indicate no significant increase in neurological or shunt complications in the perioperative period. However, it's important to note that this is a retrospective study on a relatively small number of patients, so more research may be needed to confirm these findings. As always, individual patient care should be guided by a thorough understanding of each case and consultation with appropriate medical specialists.","No. The study results suggested that spinal cord untethering may be unnecessary in patients with MM who are undergoing scoliosis corrective surgery and do not present with clinical symptoms of a tethered cord, even though tethering is radiographically demonstrated.",0.5,0.874181742,0.390443548
Do some U.S. states have higher/lower injury mortality rates than others?,"['This article examines the hypothesis that the six U.S. states with the highest rates of road traffic deaths (group 1 states) also had above-average rates of other forms of injury such as falling, poisoning, drowning, fire, suffocation, homicide, and suicide, and also for the retail trade and construction industries. The converse, second hypothesis, for the six states with the lowest rates of road traffic deaths (group 2 states) is also examined.\nData for these 12 states for the period 1983 to 1995 included nine categories of unintentional and four categories of intentional injury.

Preoperative platelet count in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma: is it a prognostic factor?,"['Platelet count is inversely related to prognosis in many cancers; however, its role in esophageal cancer is still controversial. The purpose of this study was to determine the prognostic value of preoperative platelet count in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).\nFrom January 2006 to December 2008, a retrospective analysis of 425 consecutive patients with ESCC was conducted. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for survival prediction was plotted to verify the optimum cutoff point for preoperative platelet count.

Can gingival crevicular blood be relied upon for assessment of blood glucose level?,"[""Diabetes mellitus (DM) is undiagnosed in approximately half of the patients actually suffering from the disease. In addition, the prevalence of DM is more than twice as high as in patients with periodontitis when compared to periodontally healthy subjects. Thus, a high number of patients with periodontitis may have undiagnosed DM. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate whether blood oozing from a gingival crevice during routine periodontal examination can be used for determining glucose levels.\nObservational cross-sectional studies were carried out in 75 patients (43 males and 32 females) with chronic periodontitis who were divided into two groups: Group I and Group II, respectively. Blood oozing from the gingival crevices of anterior teeth following periodontal probing was collected with the stick of glucose self-monitoring device, and the blood glucose levels were measured. At the same time, finger-prick blood was taken for glucometric analysis and subsequent readings were recorded.\nThe patient's blood glucose values ranged from 74 to 256 mg/dl. The comparison between gingival crevicular blood and finger-prick blood showed a very strong correlation, with a t value of 3.97 (at P value = 0.001).""]"," Yes, the study suggests that there is a strong correlation between blood glucose levels obtained from gingival crevicular fluid and finger-prick blood, indicating that gingival crevicular blood can potentially be used for determining glucose levels.

Should all patients be optimized to the same preoperative hemoglobin level to avoid transfusion in primary knee arthroplasty?,"['Optimization of the preoperative hemoglobin (Hb) level is an effective way to reduce allogeneic transfusion in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) though the procedure is expensive, requires close monitoring and is often inconvenient for patients with reduced mobility. Our aim was to investigate the value of preoperative Hb levels to predict transfusion and thereby tailoring Hb optimization to patient characteristics.\nAll consecutive patients who undergone primary TKA in our center over 2Â\xa0years, and received tranexamic acid intraoperatively, were reviewed. The adjusted association between preoperative Hb levels and transfusion was assessed by multivariate logistic regression, and the estimated probability of transfusion for individual patients was derived from the logistic model.\nOut of the 784 patients who meet the inclusion criteria, risk of transfusion was associated with poorer performance status, as measured by the America Association of Anestesiology (ASA) score III/IV (OR: 3Â·3, PÂ\xa0<Â\xa00Â·001) and lower preoperative Hb level (OR 3Â·8 for each g/dl below 13Â\xa0g/dl; PÂ\xa0<Â\xa00Â·001).

However, the study does not suggest that all patients should be optimized to the same preoperative hemoglobin level to avoid transfusion. Instead, it seems that the optimal preoperative hemoglobin level may vary depending on the patient's overall health status as measured by the ASA score. Therefore, individualized optimization of the preoperative hemoglobin level based on each patient's characteristics may be more appropriate to reduce the risk of allogeneic transfusion in primary total knee arthroplasty.","No. Not all the patients undergoing TKA who receive tranexamic acid need the same preoperative Hb optimization target.

Does pediatric housestaff experience influence tests ordered for infants in the neonatal intensive care unit?,"['To assess the relationship between the experience of pediatric housestaff and tests ordered on infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (ICU).\nProspective, cohort study over one full academic year.\nOne academic Level III neonatal intensive care nursery.\nData were collected prospectively on all 785 infants admitted to the neonatal ICU from July 1993 to June 1994. These infants were cared for by 14 different categorical pediatric housestaff.\nOur neonatal ICU has either a resident or an intern on-call by himself/herself at night, affording us a natural setting to compare intern vs. resident test ordering. The outcomes of interest were number of arterial blood gases, radiographs, and electrolytes ordered per infant by the on-call pediatric houseofficer, as tabulated the morning after the call night. Control variables included the severity-of-illness of the individual infant (using the Neonatal Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System), the workload of the houseofficer (number of patients, number of admissions), and supervision (rounding frequency and on-call attending). Controlling for the severity-of-illness of the infant, the workload on the call night, and supervision with multiple linear regression, we found that interns ordered significantly (p = .02) greater numbers of arterial blood gases per infant than residents, amounting to some 0.33 blood gases per infant per call night (3.22 vs. 2.89 arterial blood gases per infant per night). This increase of 0.33 blood gases per infant amounts to interns ordering $169 more arterial blood gases per call night at our institution.

The clinical significance of bile duct sludge: is it different from bile duct stones?,"['Some patients with suspected common bile duct (CBD) stones are found to have sludge and no stones. Although sludge in the gallbladder is a precursor of gallbladder stones, the significance of bile duct sludge (BDS) is poorly defined. This study aimed to compare BDS with bile duct stones in terms of frequency, associated risk factors, and clinical outcome after endoscopic therapy.\nThe study enrolled 228 patients who underwent therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for suspected choledocholithiasis. The patients were divided into two groups: patients with BDS but no stones on ERCP and patients with CBD stones. The presence of risk factors for bile duct stones (age, periampullary diverticulum, ductal dilation or angulation, previous open cholecystectomy) were assessed at ERCP. Follow-up data (36 +/- 19 months) were obtained from medical records and by patient questioning.\nBile duct sludge occurred in 14% (31/228) of patients and was more common in females. After endoscopic clearance, CBD stones recurred in 17% (33/197) of the patients with CBD stones, and in 16% (5/31) of the patients with BDS (p = 0.99).

Is the covering of the resection margin after distal pancreatectomy advantageous?,"[""In recent years, many advances in pancreatic surgery have been achieved. Nevertheless, the rate of pancreatic fistula following pancreatic tail resection does not differ between various techniques, still reaching up to 30% in prospective multicentric studies.

Therefore, further prospective studies with standardized radiotherapy regimes are needed to confirm these findings.","No. The palliative treatment concept of 25Â Gy applied in 5Â fractions is sufficient for radiation of lung cancer, given that there was no obvious survival improvement in patients treated with the higher total dose regimen.",0.375,0.941447244,0.45057996
May mean platelet volume levels be a predictor in the diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease?,"['Our aim in this study was to investigate whether mean platelet volume (MPV) value could be used as an early marker to predict pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).\nOverall, 44 patients with PID and 44 healthy women were included in the study. The control group consisted of 44 women who applied to the clinic for a routine gynaecological check-up, without chronic disease or a history of medication use. Owing to the fact that it would affect thrombocyte function, women who have the following conditions were excluded from the study: women who were taking anticoagulant therapy, oral contraceptives, nonsteroid anti-inflammatory medications and who had chronic diseases. The leukocyte count, platelet count, neutrophil ratio and MPV values were collected from PID and the control group. C reactive protein values of patients with PID were also noted.\nMPV values in patients with PID were lower than those in the control group. This reduction in MPV is statistically significant when the PID patient group is compared with the control group (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). A negative correlation was discovered between platelet count and MPV values (pâ€‰=â€‰0.019, râ€‰=â€‰-â€‰0.425). Receiver-operating curve analysis pointed out that MPV has greater area under curve value than neutrophil rate, leukocyte and platelet count (0.73, 0.64, 0.72 and 0.49 respectively).']"," Yes, the study suggests that mean platelet volume (MPV) levels may be a useful predictor in the diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). The results indicate that MPV values are significantly lower in patients with PID compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, there was a negative correlation between platelet count and MPV values, and the area under the receiver-operating curve for MPV was greater than for other commonly used markers such as neutrophil ratio, leukocyte, and platelet count. However, it is important to note that this study only provides preliminary evidence, and further research would be needed to confirm these findings and establish the clinical utility of using MPV as a diagnostic marker for PID.","Yes. Since the MPV value was significantly decreased in patients with PID, it may serve as an additional and even more valuable marker than leukocyte count in the diagnosis of PID.",0.875,0.801542027,0.934443414
Have antiepileptic drug prescription claims changed following the FDA suicidality warning?,"['In January 2008, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) communicated concerns and, in May 2009, issued a warning about an increased risk of suicidality for all antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).

No exclusion criteria were based on the size, number, or location of myomas.\nLaparoscopic myomectomy and modifications of the technique: enucleation of the myoma by morcellation while it is still attached to the uterus with and without earlier devascularization.\nIn all, 912 myomas were removed in these 505 patients laparoscopically. The mean number of myomas removed was 1.85 +/- 5.706 (95% CI 1.72-1.98). In all, 184 (36.4%) patients had multiple myomectomy. The mean size of the myomas removed was 5.86 +/- 3.300 cm in largest diameter (95% CI 5.56-6.16 cm). The mean weight of the myomas removed was 227.74 +/- 325.801 g (95% CI 198.03-257.45 g) and median was 100 g. The median operating time was 60 minutes (range 30-270 minutes).

c-Kit-dependent growth of uveal melanoma cells: a potential therapeutic target?,"['This study was conducted to investigate the expression and functional impact of the proto-oncogene c-kit in uveal melanoma.\nBased on immunohistochemical (IHC) study of paraffin-embedded specimens from 134 uveal melanomas and Western blot analysis on eight fresh-frozen samples the expression of c-kit in uveal melanoma was studied. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of c-kit and the impact of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 was examined in the three uveal melanoma cell lines OCM-1, OCM-3, and 92-1.\nEighty-four of 134 paraffin-embedded samples and six of eight fresh-frozen samples expressed c-kit. c-Kit was strongly expressed and tyrosine phosphorylated in cultured uveal melanoma cells compared with cutaneous melanoma cells. Moreover, in contrast to cutaneous melanoma cell lines c-kit maintained a high phosphorylation level in serum-depleted uveal melanoma cells. No activation-related mutations in exon 11 of the KIT gene were found. On the contrary, expression of the stem cell growth factor (c-kit ligand) was detected in all three uveal melanoma cell lines, suggesting the presence of autocrine (paracrine) stimulation pathways. Treatment of uveal melanoma cell lines with STI571, which blocks c-kit autophosphorylation, resulted in cell death. The IC(50) of the inhibitory effects on c-kit phosphorylation and cell proliferation was of equal size and less than 2.5 microM.']"," Yes, based on this study, c-Kit appears to be a potential therapeutic target for uveal melanoma. The proto-oncogene c-kit is expressed in the majority of uveal melanomas, and its phosphorylation level is higher in uveal melanoma cells compared to cutaneous melanoma cells. This suggests that c-Kit plays a significant role in the growth and survival of uveal melanoma cells.

The study also found that the tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571, which blocks c-kit autophosphorylation, leads to cell death in uveal melanoma cell lines. The IC50 (the concentration required for 50% inhibition) of the inhibitory effects on c-kit phosphorylation and cell proliferation was less than 2.5 microM, indicating a potent effect of STI571 on these cells.

Open ileocolic resections for Crohn's disease (Group IV) were associated with higher morbidity, longer hospital stays, and a higher conversion rate to open procedures. This suggests that laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resection may offer advantages in terms of complications and recovery time.

It is important to note that this study compares laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resections with open ileocolic resections, not with each other directly within the same groups. Therefore, direct comparisons between the groups should be made with caution.

In conclusion, while abscesses, phlegmons, or recurrent disease may complicate the procedure, they do not appear to be absolute contraindications for laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resection in patients with Crohn's disease.","No. The laparoscopic-assisted approach to Crohn's disease is feasible and safe with good outcomes.

Is low serum chloride level a risk factor for cardiovascular mortality?,"[""Serum chloride level is routinely assayed in clinical laboratories in the management of patients with kidney disorders and with metabolic diseases. It is a biological parameter that is easily, precisely and relatively cheaply measured. The epidemiological features of serum chloride levels have not been studied before.\nFor the random sample of men and women from the Belgian Interuniversity Research on Nutrition and Health aged 25-74 years, free of symptomatic coronary heart disease at baseline, serum chloride concentrations were measured, among those of other electrolytes. The cohort was followed up for 10 years with respect to subsequent cause-specific mortality.\nThe results are based on observations of 4793 men and 4313 women. According to Cox regression analysis serum chloride level was one of the strongest predictors of total, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and non-CVD mortalities independently of age, body mass index, sex, smoking, systolic blood pressure, levels of total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, uric acid, serum creatinine and serum total proteins and intake of diuretics. This relation was proved to be independent of levels of other serum electrolytes and similar for men and women. The estimated adjusted risk ratio for CVD death for subjects with a serum chloride level<or =100 mmol/l compared with those with levels above that limit was 1.65 (95% confidence interval 1.06-2.57) for men and 2.16 (95% confidence interval 1.11-4.22) for women. The study of adjusted risk ratios for four groups of subjects defined on the basis of their baseline serum chloride levels revealed a decreasing log-linear 'dose-response' relation to total and cardiovascular mortalities.""]"," Yes, low serum chloride level appears to be a risk factor for cardiovascular mortality. The study found that individuals with a serum chloride level of 100 mmol/l or lower had an increased risk of cardiovascular death compared to those with levels above that limit, particularly in women. The risk was approximately 65% higher for men and double for women. The study also suggested a dose-response relationship between serum chloride level and mortality risk. However, it's important to note that this is based on one specific study and more research may be needed to confirm these findings and understand the underlying mechanisms.","Yes. This s the first report from a population-based study to indicate that there is an association between serum chloride level and the incidence of total, CVD and non-CVD mortalities. The risk ratio for CVD mortality associated with a low serum chloride level was comparable to or higher than those observed for well-established CVD risk factors.",0.9,0.932692201,0.751398426
Are many colorectal cancers due to missed adenomas?,"['An unknown number of colorectal cancers could be due to missed adenomas during previous endoscopy. Data in the literature are sparse.

All patients who underwent more than one endoscopy and in whom ultimately cancer was diagnosed were studied separately.\nColorectal cancer was diagnosed in 835 patients. Twenty-five patients underwent a previous endoscopy without a cancer diagnosis. These 25 patients were divided into three groups according to the time between the endoscopy in which the cancer was detected and the previous endoscopy. Five out of these 25 patients underwent regular surveillance. Only 11 patients had no argument for regular follow-up.

Does oral Î±-galactosidase relieve irritable bowel symptoms?,"['Abdominal bloating is reported by a majority of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients. Excess colonic fermentation may cause gaseous symptoms. Several foodstuffs contain oligosaccharides with an Î±-galactosidic linkage that is resistant to mammalian hydrolases. Assisted hydrolysis by exogenous Î±-galactosidase enzyme (AG) could offer a way of controlling IBS symptoms by reducing colonic fermentation and gas production. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of AG on symptom severity and quality of life in IBS patients with abdominal bloating or flatulence.\nA total of 125 subjects with IBS received AG or placebo at meals for 12 weeks. IBS-Symptom Severity Score (IBS-SSS) and quality of life (QoL) were assessed at baseline, during the treatment and at 4-week follow-up.\nAG showed a trend toward a more prominent decrease in IBS-SSS. The responder rate at week 16 was higher for the AG group. No difference was detected in QoL between AG and placebo groups. A total of 25 patients (18 in AG group and 7 in placebo group, p = 0.016) withdrew from the study.

However, no significant difference in quality of life was detected between the two groups. It's also important to note that more patients in the AG group withdrew from the study, with abdominal pain and diarrhea being more commonly reported reasons for withdrawal. This suggests that while oral Î±-galactosidase may have some potential in relieving IBS symptoms, it could potentially cause adverse effects such as abdominal pain and diarrhea. It's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare provider before starting any new treatment regimen.","No. We found no evidence to support the use of AG routinely in IBS patients.

Patient referrals were aggregated to give private and NHS referral rates for each electoral ward in each practice.\nOf 17,137 referrals, 90.4 percent (15,495) were to the NHS and 9.6 percent (1642) to the private sector. Private referral rates were lower in patients from the most deprived fifth of wards compared with the least deprived fifth (rate ratio 0.25, 95 percent CI 0.15 to 0.41, p<0.001), whereas NHS referral rates were slightly higher in patients in the most deprived fifth of wards (rate ratio 1.18, 95 percent CI 0.98 to 1.42, p = 0.08) both after age standardisation and adjustment for practice. The NHS referral rate was significantly higher (rate ratio 1.40, 95 percent CI 1.15 to 1.71, p = 0.001) in wards with private referral rates in the top fifth compared with the bottom fifth after adjustment for deprivation and practice.']"," Based on this study, it appears that increased use of private health care does not necessarily reduce demand for NHS care.

Do socioeconomic differences in mortality persist after retirement?,"['To assess the risk of death associated with work based and non-work based measures of socioeconomic status before and after retirement age.\nFollow up study of mortality in relation to employment grade and car ownership over 25 years.\nThe first Whitehall study.\n18,133 male civil servants aged 40-69 years who attended a screening examination between 1967 and 1970.\nDeath.\nGrade of employment was a strong predictor of mortality before retirement. For men dying at ages 40-64 the lowest employment grade had 3.12 times the mortality of the highest grade (95% confidence interval 2.4 to 4.1). After retirement the ability of grade to predict mortality declined (rate ratio 1.86; 1.6 to 2.2). A non-work based measure of socioeconomic status (car ownership) predicted mortality less well than employment grade before retirement but its ability to predict mortality declined less after retirement. Using a relative index of inequality that was sensitive to the distribution among socioeconomic groups showed employment grade and car ownership to have independent associations with mortality that were of equal magnitude after retirement. The absolute difference in death rates between the lowest and highest employment grades increased with age from 12.9 per 1000 person years at ages 40-64 to 38.3 per 1000 at ages 70-89.']"," Yes, socioeconomic differences in mortality persist after retirement, but the ability of employment grade as a work-based measure to predict mortality declines after retirement compared to before.

Socioeconomic differences in mortality persist beyond retirement age and in magnitude increase with age. Social differentials in mortality based on an occupational status measure seem to decrease to a greater degree after retirement than those based on a non-work measure. This suggests that alongside other socioeconomic factors work itself may play an important part in generating social inequalities in health in men of working age.,1,0.950541614,0.534612406
Is robotically assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy less invasive than retropubic radical prostatectomy?,"[""To evaluate whether robotically assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) is less invasive than radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP), as experimental studies suggest that the acute phase reaction is proportional to surgery-induced tissue damage.\nBetween May and November 2006, all patients undergoing RRP or RALP in our department were prospectively assessed. Blood samples were collected 24 h before (T0), during surgery (T1), at the end of anaesthesia (T2), and 12 (T3) and 24 h after surgery (T4), and assayed for interleukin(IL)-6 and IL-1 alpha, C-reactive protein (CRP), and lactate.

Availability of sports facilities and parks was assessed by means of geographic information systems within the zip-code area and within a 1600 meter buffer. Multilevel logistic regression analyses, with neighborhood and individual as levels, were conducted to examine associations between physical and social environmental factors and leisure time sports participation. Simple slopes analysis was conducted to decompose interaction effects.\nNSC was significantly associated with sports participation (OR: 3.51 (95%CI: 1.18;10.41)) after adjustment for potential confounders. Availability of sports facilities and availability of parks were not associated with sports participation. A significant interaction between NSC and density of parks within the neighbourhood area (OR: 1.22 (90%CI: 1.01;1.34)) was found.

For combined readings, results were considered positive if either of the two interpreters reported finding a polyp or carcinoma. A McNemar test was used to compare the first reader's results with the combined results of the first and second readers. Results were retrospectively correlated with endoscopic or surgical results in 360 patients, and agreement between first and combined readings and endoscopic results was determined.\nAdding a second reader increased the number of positive results on examinations from 249 to 315 (p<0.0001) and resulted in potential alteration of clinical treatment in 98 patients (9.9%).

While the effects on the mutation in the DNA replication-related element (DRE) in cultured cells have been studied extensively, the consequences of elevating wild-type DREF activity in developing tissues have hitherto remained unclear.\nWe over-expressed DREF in the wing imaginal disc using a GAL4-UAS targeted expression system in Drosophila. Over-expression of DREF induced a notching wing phenotype, which was associated with ectopic apoptosis. A half reduction of the reaper, head involution defective and grim gene dose suppressed this DREF-induced notching wing phenotype. Furthermore, this was also the case with co-expression of baculovirus P35, a caspase inhibitor. In addition, over-expression of the 32 kDa boundary element-associated factor (BEAF-32), thought to compete against DREF for common binding sites in genomic regions, rescued the DREF-induced notching wing phenotype, while a half reduction of the genomic region, including the BEAF-32 gene, exerted enhancing effects. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence for a genetic interaction between DREF and BEAF-32.']"," Over-expression of DREF in the wing imaginal disc of Drosophila induces a notching wing phenotype associated with ectopic apoptosis.

Additionally, over-expression of BEAF-32, which competes with DREF for common binding sites in genomic regions, rescues the DREF-induced notching wing phenotype.

Does the molecular biology of the olive fly come of age?,"[""Olive cultivation blends with the history of the Mediterranean countries since ancient times. Even today, activities around the olive tree constitute major engagements of several people in the countryside of both sides of the Mediterranean basin. The olive fly is, beyond doubt, the most destructive pest of cultivated olives. The female fly leaves its eggs in the olive fruit. Upon emergence, the larvae feed on the olive sap, thus destroying the fruit. If untreated, practically all olives get infected. The use of chemical insecticides constitutes the principal olive fly control approach. The Sterile Insect Technique (SIT), an environmentally friendly alternative control method, had been tried in pilot field applications in the 1970's, albeit with no practical success. This was mainly attributed to the low, non-antagonistic quality of the mixed-sex released insects. Many years of experience from successful SIT applications in related species, primarily the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata, demonstrated that efficient SIT protocols require the availability of fundamental genetic and molecular information.\nAmong the primary systems whose understanding can contribute towards novel SIT approaches (or its recently developed alternative RIDL: Release of Insects carrying a Dominant Lethal) is the reproductive, since the ability to manipulate the reproductive system would directly affect the insect's fertility. In addition, the analysis of early embryonic promoters and apoptotic genes would provide tools that confer dominant early-embryonic lethality during mass-rearing. Here we report the identification of several genes involved in these systems through whole transcriptome analysis of female accessory glands (FAGs) and spermathecae, as well as male testes. Indeed, analysis of differentially expressed genes in these tissues revealed higher metabolic activity in testes than in FAGs/spermathecae. Furthermore, at least five olfactory-related genes were shown to be differentially expressed in the female and male reproductive systems analyzed. Finally, the expression profile of the embryonic serendipity-Î± locus and the pre-apoptotic head involution defective gene were analyzed during embryonic developmental stages.""]"," Yes, it appears that the molecular biology of the olive fly is advancing as researchers have identified several genes involved in reproductive systems, metabolism, olfaction, and early embryonic development through whole transcriptome analysis. This knowledge could potentially contribute to the development of more efficient Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) or its alternative RIDL methods for environmentally friendly olive fly control.","Yes. Several years of molecular studies on the olive fly can now be combined with new information from whole transcriptome analyses and lead to a deep understanding of the biology of this notorious insect pest. This is a prerequisite for the development of novel embryonic lethality female sexing strains for successful SIT efforts which, combined with improved mass-reared conditions, give new hope for efficient SIT applications for the olive fly.",1,0.75049143,0.433254762
Is mRI Background Parenchymal Enhancement Associated with Breast Cancer?,"['Previously, a strong positive association between background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) at magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and breast cancer was reported in high-risk populations. We sought to determine, whether this was also true for non-high-risk patients.\n540 consecutive patients underwent breast MRI for assessment of breast findings (BI-RADS 0-5, non-high-risk screening (no familial history of breast cancer, no known genetic mutation, no prior chest irradiation, or previous breast cancer diagnosis)) and subsequent histological work-up. For this IRB-approved study, BPE and fibroglandular tissue FGT were retrospectively assessed by two experienced radiologists according to the BI-RADS lexicon. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to explore associations between BPE, FGT, age and final diagnosis of breast cancer. Subsequently, multivariate logistic regression analysis, considering covariate colinearities, was performed, using final diagnosis as the target variable and BPE, FGT and age as covariates.\nAge showed a moderate negative correlation with FGT (r = -0.43, p<0.001) and a weak negative correlation with BPE (r = -0.28, p<0.001). FGT and BPE correlated moderately (r = 0.35, p<0.001). Final diagnosis of breast cancer displayed very weak negative correlations with FGT (r = -0.09, p = 0.046) and BPE (r = -0.156, p<0.001) and weak positive correlation with age (r = 0.353, p<0.001). On multivariate logistic regression analysis, the only independent covariate for prediction of breast cancer was age (OR 1.032, p<0.001).']"," In this study, it was found that age was the only independent predictor of breast cancer in non-high-risk patients. Background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) at magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fibroglandular tissue (FGT) were moderately correlated, but neither BPE nor FGT were found to be independent predictors of breast cancer in this patient population. This suggests that while BPE may be associated with breast cancer in high-risk populations, it is not a strong predictor of breast cancer in non-high-risk patients.","No. Based on our data, neither BPE nor FGT independently correlate with breast cancer risk in non-high-risk patients at MRI.

Does mechanical stress induce bone formation in the maxillary sinus in a short-term mouse model?,"['Clinicians occasionally face the challenge of moving a tooth through the maxillary sinus. The objective of this study was to evaluate tissue remodeling during tooth movement into the maxillary sinus, more specifically as regards to bone formation.\nThe maxillary first molar of 20 male mice was moved toward the palatal side by a nickel-titanium super elastic wire for 1 to 14Â\xa0days, and the bone remodeling around the root was evaluated using histomorphometry and immunodetection of bone-restricted Ifitm-like (Bril) protein, a novel marker of active bone formation.\nWhen mechanical stress was applied to the tooth, the periodontal ligament on the palatal side was immediately compressed to approximately half of its original width by the tipping movement of the tooth. At the same time, osteoblasts deposited new bone on the wall of the maxillary sinus prior to bone resorption by osteoclasts on the periodontal side, as evidenced by the high level of expression of Bril at this site.

Is postconditioning of sevoflurane and propofol associated with mitochondrial permeability transition pore?,"['Sevoflurane and propofol are effective cardioprotective anaesthetic agents, though the cardioprotection of propofol has not been shown in humans. Their roles and underlying mechanisms in anesthetic postconditioning are unclear. Mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) opening is a major cause of ischemia-reperfusion injury. Here we investigated sevoflurane- and propofol-induced postconditioning and their relationship with MPTP.\nIsolated perfused rat hearts were exposed to 40 min of ischemia followed by 1 h of reperfusion. During the first 15 min of reperfusion, hearts were treated with either control buffer (CTRL group) or buffer containing 20 micromol/L atractyloside (ATR group), 3% (v/v) sevoflurane (SPC group), 50 micromol/L propofol (PPC group), or the combination of atractyloside with respective anesthetics (SPC+ATR and PPC+ATR groups). Infarct size was determined by dividing the total necrotic area of the left ventricle by the total left ventricular slice area (percent necrotic area).\nHearts treated with sevoflurane or propofol showed significantly better recovery of coronary flow, end-diastolic pressures, left ventricular developed pressure and derivatives compared with controls. Sevoflurane resulted in more protective alteration of hemodynamics at most time point of reperfusion than propofol. These improvements were paralleled with the reduction of lactate dehydrogenase release and the decrease of infarct size (SPC vs CTRL: (17.48+/-2.70)% vs (48.47+/-6.03)%, P<0.05; PPC vs CTRL: (35.60+/-2.10)% vs (48.47+/-6.03)%, P<0.05). SPC group had less infarct size than PPC group (SPC vs PPC: (17.48+/-2.70)% vs (35.60+/-2.10)%, P<0.05). Atractyloside coadministration attenuated or completely blocked the cardioprotective effect of postconditioning of sevoflurane and propofol.']"," The study suggests that both sevoflurane and propofol, when used as postconditioning agents, are associated with a reduction in infarct size and improvement in hemodynamics in isolated perfused rat hearts subjected to ischemia-reperfusion injury. Sevoflurane appears to be more effective than propofol in this regard. The cardioprotective effects of both sevoflurane and propofol are mediated, at least in part, through the modulation of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) opening, as evidenced by the fact that coadministration of atractyloside, an MPTP inhibitor, attenuates or completely blocks the cardioprotective effect of postconditioning with these anesthetics.","Yes. Postconditioning of sevoflurane and propofol has cardioprotective effect against ischemia-reperfusion injury of heart, which is associated with inhibition of MPTP opening. Compared to propofol, sevoflurane provides superior protection of functional recovery and infarct size.",0.8,0.510429732,0.456775222

Do two host factors regulate persistence of H7-specific T cells injected in tumor-bearing mice?,"['Injection of CD8 T cells primed against immunodominant minor histocompatibility antigens (MiHA) such as H7(a) can eradicate leukemia and solid tumors. To understand why MiHA-targeted T cells have such a potent antitumor effect it is essential to evaluate their in vivo behavior. In the present work, we therefore addressed two specific questions: what is the proliferative dynamics of H7(a)-specifc T cells in tumors, and do H7(a)-specific T cells persist long-term after adoptive transfer?\nBy day 3 after adoptive transfer, we observed a selective infiltration of melanomas by anti-H7(a) T cells. Over the next five days, anti-H7(a) T cells expanded massively in the tumor but not in the spleen. Thus, by day 8 after injection, anti-H7(a) T cells in the tumor had undergone more cell divisions than those in the spleen. These data strongly suggest that anti-H7(a) T cells proliferate preferentially and extensively in the tumors. We also found that two host factors regulated long-term persistence of anti-H7(a) memory T cells: thymic function and expression of H7(a) by host cells. On day 100, anti-H7(a) memory T cells were abundant in euthymic H7(a)-negative (B10.H7(b)) mice, present in low numbers in thymectomized H7(a)-positive (B10) hosts, and undetectable in euthymic H7(a)-positive recipients.']"," Yes, the text suggests that two host factors regulate the long-term persistence of anti-H7(a) memory T cells injected in tumor-bearing mice.

These data suggest that intratracheal instillation of perfluorocarbon before or after induction of lung injury results in a reduction in pulmonary albumin leak.,1,0.908962607,0.720621688
Does increased response to prostaglandin H2 precede changes in PGH synthase-1 expression in the SHR aorta?,"['To determine the expression of PGH synthase-1 and the sensitivity of vascular smooth muscle to PGH2 in the aorta from the SHR at an age when no endothelium-dependent contractions to acetylcholine are observed under control conditions.\nAll experiments were performed in parallel on aortas from 20-wk-old SHR and Wistar-Kyoto normotensive rats (WKY). Rings, with or without endothelium, were suspended in conventional organ chambers for the recording of changes in isometric force. The expression of PGH synthase-1 was evaluated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis.\nUnder control conditions acetylcholine did not cause contractions of rings with or without endothelium. However, in the presence of nitro-L-arginine (NLA, an inhibitor of nitric-oxide synthase), it evoked endothelium-dependent contraction in the SHR but not in the WKY aortas. The expression of PGH synthase-1 was comparable in the aortas of both strains (with and without endothelium). PGH2 caused greater contractions in rings without endothelium from the SHR than those from WKY, while U46,619 evoked a comparable response, in aortas from both strains.']"," Based on the provided context and experimental results, it appears that increased response to prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) precedes changes in PGH synthase-1 expression in the SHR aorta. This is suggested by the observation that the contraction response to PGH2 was greater in rings without endothelium from the SHR than those from WKY, while the expression of PGH synthase-1 was comparable in the aortas of both strains. However, it's important to note that this interpretation is based on the data presented and further studies may be needed to confirm this relationship.","Yes. In the aorta of 20-wk-old SHR, endothelium-dependent contractions to acetylcholine are observed only when the production of nitric oxide is prevented.

Are both plasma lysophosphatidic acid and serum autotaxin levels increased in chronic hepatitis C?,"['Recent accumulating evidence indicates that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a lipid mediator, abundantly present in blood, with a wide range of biologic actions including the regulation of proliferation and contraction in liver cells. Although it is speculated that LPA might play a role in pathophysiologic processes in vivo, not only its role but also even a possible alteration in its blood concentration under specific diseases is essentially unknown. Autotaxin (ATX), originally purified as an autocrine motility factor for melanoma cells, was revealed to be a key enzyme in LPA synthesis. We determined LPA and ATX levels in the blood of patients with liver disease.\nATX activity was measured by determining choline with the substrate of lysophosphatidylcholine, and the LPA level by an enzymatic cycling method in 41 patients with chronic hepatitis C.\nThe serum ATX activity and plasma LPA level were significantly increased in patients, and were correlated positively with serum hyaluronic acid, and negatively with platelets, albumin, and prothrombin time.

Is the combination of cobinamide and sulfanegen highly effective in mouse models of cyanide poisoning?,"['Cyanide is a component of smoke in residential and industrial fires, and accidental exposure to cyanide occurs in a variety of industries. Moreover, cyanide has the potential to be used by terrorists, particularly in a closed space such as an airport or train station. Current therapies for cyanide poisoning must be given by intravenous administration, limiting their use in treating mass casualties.\nWe are developing two new cyanide antidotes--cobinamide, a vitamin B(12) analog, and sulfanegen, a 3-mercaptopyruvate prodrug. Both drugs can be given by intramuscular administration, and therefore could be used to treat a large number of people quickly. We now asked if the two drugs would have an augmented effect when combined.\nWe used a non-lethal and two different lethal models of cyanide poisoning in mice. The non-lethal model assesses neurologic recovery by quantitatively evaluating the innate righting reflex time of a mouse. The two lethal models are a cyanide injection and a cyanide inhalation model.\nWe found that the two drugs are at least additive when used together in both the non-lethal and lethal models: at doses where all animals died with either drug alone, the combination yielded 80 and 40% survival in the injection and inhalation models, respectively. Similarly, drug doses that yielded 40% survival with either drug alone, yielded 80 and 100% survival in the injection and inhalation models, respectively. As part of the inhalation model, we developed a new paradigm in which animals are exposed to cyanide gas, injected intramuscularly with an antidote, and then re-exposed to cyanide gas. This simulates cyanide exposure of a large number of people in a closed space, because people would remain exposed to cyanide, even after receiving an antidote.']"," Yes, the combination of cobinamide and sulfanegen appears to be highly effective in mouse models of cyanide poisoning, as it significantly increases survival rates compared to when each drug is used alone. This could potentially make these drugs more useful in treating mass casualties from cyanide exposure, such as in fires or terrorist attacks. However, further research would be needed to confirm these findings and determine the safety and efficacy of this combination in humans.",Yes. The combination of cobinamide and sulfanegen shows great promise as a new approach to treating cyanide poisoning.,1,0.550467203,0.719705058
Does platonin mitigate lung injury in a two-hit model of hemorrhage/resuscitation and endotoxemia in rats?,"['Traumatic hemorrhagic shock and subsequent resuscitation may promote bacteria translocation and cause endotoxemia, a two-hit process that will induce severe lung injury. The pathogenesis involves oxidative stress, neutrophil infiltration, and inflammatory response. Platonin, a potent antioxidant, possesses potent anti-inflammation capacity.

Sham groups were used simultaneously. At 6 hours after resuscitation, rats were killed and the levels of lung injury were assayed.\nRats treated with HS/L alone had severe lung injury as evidenced by significant alterations in lung function (i.e., arterial blood gas and alveolar-arterial oxygen difference) and histology. Significant increases in polymorphonuclear leukocytes/alveoli ratio (neutrophil infiltration index) and significant increases in the concentrations of inflammatory molecules (including chemokine, cytokine, and prostaglandin E2) and malondialdehyde (lipid peroxidation index) revealed that HS/L caused significant oxidative stress, neutrophil infiltration, and inflammatory response in rat lungs. Moreover, our data revealed that the levels of functional and histologic alteration as well as polymorphonuclear leukocytes/alveoli ratio and the concentrations of inflammatory molecules and malondialdehyde in rats treated with HS/L plus platonin (200 Î¼g/kg) were significantly lower than those treated with HR/L alone.']"," Yes, the study suggests that Platonin mitigates lung injury in a two-hit model of hemorrhage/resuscitation and endotoxemia in rats.

Is pretransplant administration of a single donor class I major histocompatibility complex molecule sufficient for the indefinite survival of fully allogeneic cardiac allografts : evidence for linked epitope suppression?,"['Allograft survival can be prolonged by the administration of alloantigen(s) before transplantation. Blood transfusion is the commonest form of alloantigen pretreatment currently used in clinical practice. However, for recipients of organs from cadaver donors, it is not possible to predict the identity of the organ donor in advance. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that all the alloantigens expressed by a cadaver organ donor will be represented in the alloantigen pretreatment inoculum. We have previously shown that it is not necessary to expose the recipient to the full complement of donor alloantigens to induce long-term survival of a subsequent cardiac allograft. Here, we investigated the in vivo mechanism responsible for this phenomena.\nUnresponsiveness to the mouse MHC class I molecule Kb was induced in CBA.Ca (H2k) recipients by administration of bone marrow cells from transgenic CBA mice, CBK (H2k + Kb) before transplantation of fully allogeneic and F1 vascularized cardiac allografts.\nPretreatment with CBK bone marrow cells resulted in the long-term survival of all cardiac allografts expressing H2-Kb. For example, C57BL/10 (H2b) and (CBKxBALB/c) F1 (H2k,d + Kb) cardiac allografts were accepted by recipients treated with CBK bone marrow cells before transplantation. In contrast, allografts that did not express Kb, such as BALB/c (H2d) or (CBAxBALB/c) F1 (H2k,d), were rejected acutely, with a median survival time (MST) of 7 and 6 days, respectively, in recipients treated with CBK bone marrow cells. Furthermore, when recipients pretreated with CBK bone marrow cells were grafted with a BALB/c heart and a CBK heart simultaneously, the BALB/c hearts were rejected (MST=10 days), whereas the CBK hearts were accepted. By contrast, in the maintenance phase (i.e., after transplantation), recipients with long-term surviving (CBKxBALB/c) F1 hearts (> 100 days) were found to accept BALB/c hearts indefinitely, whereas fourth-party B10.S (H2s) grafts were rejected (MST=7.5 days). This indicated that the allografts bearing Kb could tolerize recipients to other alloantigens expressed by the transplanted heart.']"," The study suggests that pretransplant administration of a single donor class I major histocompatibility complex molecule (Kb) is sufficient for the indefinite survival of fully allogeneic cardiac allografts, as demonstrated by long-term survival of (CBKxBALB/c) F1 hearts and rejection of BALB/c hearts. This phenomenon may be due to a mechanism called linked epitope suppression, where exposure to one alloantigen (Kb) leads to tolerance of other alloantigens expressed by the transplanted heart. However, it's important to note that this study was conducted in mice and further research is needed to determine if these findings can be applied to human organ transplantation.",Yes.

Does reverse remodeling of the myocardial extracellular matrix after prolonged left ventricular assist device support follow a biphasic pattern?,"['Collagens are important components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Alterations in collagen structure and composition can lead to end-stage heart failure. Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are frequently used as a bridge to heart transplantation (HTx). In this study, we analyzed changes in composition of the collagens as well as the synthesis or degradation of these collagens after prolonged LVAD support.\nThe ECM volume was quantified after Picro-Sirius red staining. With immunohistochemistry (IHC), Type I and Type III collagen proteins were analyzed and, using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), collagen mRNA expression was analyzed. Collagen synthesis and degradation was studied by measuring N-terminal pro-peptide for Type I collagen (PINP), N-terminal pro-peptide for Type III collagen (PIIINP) and carboxyterminal telopeptide for Type I collagen (ICTP) in plasma. Collagen composition was measured using the hydroxyproline/Sircol assay.\nThe ECM volume increased in the first 200 days after LVAD implantation. At between 200 and 400 days the ECM volume decreased, but remained higher than pre-LVAD. After 400 days the ECM volume was smaller than the pre-LVAD volume. IHC did not show a significant difference pre- and post-LVAD for collagen composition. Collagen mRNA expression did not change but an augmented synthesis of collagen during the first month after LVAD support was detected upon measurement of plasma PINP and PIIINP levels. In addition, the quality of the collagen network improved.']"," Yes, it appears that the remodeling of the myocardial extracellular matrix after prolonged left ventricular assist device support follows a biphasic pattern, as suggested by the findings from this study on MI in mice. The initial phase involves increased expression and accumulation of LOX isoforms and collagen fibers, leading to scar formation and increased stiffness. This is followed by a later phase where treatment with LOX inhibitors or neutralizing antibodies against the canonical LOX isoform attenuates collagen accumulation and maturation, resulting in reduced ventricular dilatation and improved cardiac function. However, it's important to note that this study was conducted on mice and further research would be needed to confirm these findings in humans undergoing prolonged left ventricular assist device support.","Yes. Reverse remodeling during LVAD support follows a biphasic pattern. Initially, an increase in Type I and Type III collagen turnover occurs, which is paralleled by a volume increase of the ECM.

When the mean from both test results in the 2-sample group was used, 10.1% had a positive test outcome (P<.05). The detection rates for advanced neoplasia were 3.1% in the 1-sample group, 4.1% in the 2-sample group with at least 1 positive test outcome, 2.5% when both test results were positive, and 3.7% among subjects with the mean from both test results being positive.']"," The diagnostic yield (the percentage of individuals with a positive test result) for advanced neoplasia appears to be higher in the group that collected two samples compared to those who collected one sample. However, it's important to note that attendance rates were similar between the two groups. This suggests that collecting two samples may improve the diagnostic yield without affecting attendance. The study also found that using the mean of both test results further increased the positive test outcome rate.","Yes. There is no difference in attendance for subjects offered 1- or 2-sample FIT screening. The results allow for the development of efficient FIT screening strategies that can be adapted for local colonoscopy capacities, rather than varying the cut-off value in a 1-sample strategy.",1,0.482951778,0.503000823

Do recent and dynamic transposable elements contribute to genomic divergence under asexuality?,"['Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile pieces of genetic information with high mutagenic potential for the host genome. Transposition is often neutral or deleterious but may also generate potentially adaptive genetic variation. This additional source of variation could be especially relevant in non-recombining species reproducing asexually. However, evidence is lacking to determine the relevance of TEs in plant asexual genome evolution and their associated effects. Here, we characterize the repetitive fraction of the genome of the common dandelion, Taraxacum officinale and compare it between five accessions from the same apomictic lineage. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the extent of within-lineage divergence attributed to TE content and activity. We examined the repetitive genomic contribution, diversity, transcription and methylation changes to characterize accession-specific TEs.\nUsing low-coverage genomic sequencing, we report a highly heterogeneous TE compartment in the triploid apomict T. officinale representing up to 38.6Â\xa0% of the homoploid genome. The repetitive compartment is dominated by LTR retrotransposon families accompanied by few non-LTR retrotransposons and DNA transposons. Up to half of the repeat clusters are biased towards very high read identity, indicating recent and potentially ongoing activity of these TE families. Interestingly, the five accessions are divided into two main clades based on their TE composition. Clade 2 is more dynamic than clade 1 with higher abundance of Gypsy Chromovirus sequences and transposons. Furthermore, a few low-abundant genomic TE clusters exhibit high level of transcription in two of the accessions analysed. Using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing, we detected 18.9Â\xa0% of loci differentially methylated, of which 25.4 and 40.7Â\xa0% are annotated as TEs or functional genes, respectively. Additionally, we show clear evidence for accession-specific TE families that are differentially transcribed and differentially methylated within the apomictic lineage, including one Copia Ale II LTR element and a PIF-Harbinger DNA transposon.']"," Yes, recent and dynamic transposable elements (TEs) do contribute to genomic divergence under asexuality in the common dandelion, Taraxacum officinale.

Do analysis of the attachment and differentiation of three-dimensional rotary wall vessel cultured human preosteoblasts on dental implant surfaces?,"['The purpose of this study was to determine whether osseous tissues engineered in three-dimensional (3D) environments preserved their mineralizing capacity and retained biologic characteristics when cultured on dental implant surfaces.\nHuman preosteoblast cells were cultured in both 3D rotary wall vessels and on 2D tissue culture plastic plates for 3 days. Aggregates from the 3D chambers and cells from the 2D plates were collected and transferred to commercially pure titanium disks with either 600-grit polished or sandblasted surfaces. These were cultured for an additional 7 days. The aggregates and cells from the disks were collected and prepared for scanning electron microscopy for microscopic evaluation and atomic adsorption assays for mineral content analysis. Additionally, staining with Alizarin red S was performed to compare the mineralization amount and pattern in each group. Polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed to evaluate expression of osteogenic genes, including Runx2, FAK, bone morphogenetic protein 2, and osteocalcin.\nCells from 3D rotary wall vessel cultures attached to implant surfaces and presented cell attachment and growth patterns similar to those of standard 2D cultured cells, showing evidence of radial and random growth, yet they formed multiple focal niches on implant surfaces out of which cells proliferated. The 3D cultured cells and osseous tissues retained higher amounts of mineral formed during the initial culture and showed a higher tendency toward mineralization on implant surfaces compared to standard cultured cells.

Is myocardial cytokine gene expression higher in aortic stenosis than in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy?,"['To investigate cytokine gene expression in patients with aortic valve stenosis (AS) and with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and to correlate wall stress with myocardial proinflammatory cytokine gene expression.\nHuman left ventricular (LV) myocardial biopsies were obtained for subsequent reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), interleukin (IL)-1beta, and IL-6 mRNA. The study population consisted of 24 patients with AS and 10 patients with idiopathic DCM.\nPatients with AS had a larger ejection fraction (56 (5) v 37 (4)%, p < 0.01), smaller LV end diastolic volumes (146 (11) v 267 (21) ml, p < 0.01), and lower end systolic wall stress (44 (7) v 112 (11) kdyn/cm2, p < 0.001).

Is higher glucose on admission associated with need for angioembolization in stable pelvic fracture?,"['Angioembolization is an effective adjunct to the management of retroperitoneal hemorrhage in pelvic fractures. Most patients with stable-type pelvic fracture are treated conservatively. However, in some stable pelvic fracture cases, patients should receive angioembolization for hemostasis upon incidental finding of contrast extravasation on computed tomography (CT). In this study, we attempted to define the characteristics of patients with stable pelvic fracture requiring angioembolization.\nWe retrospectively reviewed the charts of patients with pelvic fractures between January 2005 and November 2009. We focused on stable pelvic fracture patients with contrast extravasation on CT who then received angioembolization. The demographics, Injury Severity Score (ISS), Abbreviated Injury Scale score, and the blood glucose levels on admission were analyzed.\nIn total, 334 patients were enrolled. Patients with higher blood glucose level on admission with stable pelvic fracture had a higher rate of angioembolization.

Do increased accumulation of magnetic nanoparticles by magnetizable implant materials for the treatment of implant-associated complications?,"['In orthopaedic surgery, accumulation of agents such as anti-infectives in the bone as target tissue is difficult. The use of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) as carriers principally enables their accumulation via an externally applied magnetic field. Magnetizable implants are principally able to increase the strength of an externally applied magnetic field to reach also deep-seated parts in the body. Therefore, the integration of bone-addressed therapeutics in MNPs and their accumulation at a magnetic orthopaedic implant could improve the treatment of implant related infections. In this study a martensitic steel platelet as implant placeholder was used to examine its accumulation and retention capacity of MNPs in an in vitro experimental set up considering different experimental frame conditions as magnet quantity and distance to each other, implant thickness and flow velocity.\nThe magnetic field strength increased to approximately 112% when a martensitic stainless steel platelet was located between the magnet poles. Therewith a significantly higher amount of magnetic nanoparticles could be accumulated in the area of the platelet compared to the sole magnetic field. During flushing of the tube system mimicking the in vivo blood flow, the magnetized platelet was able to retain a higher amount of MNPs without an external magnetic field compared to the set up with no mounted platelet during flushing of the system. Generally, a higher flow velocity led to lower amounts of accumulated MNPs. A higher quantity of magnets and a lower distance between magnets led to a higher magnetic field strength. Albeit not significantly the magnetic field strength tended to increase with thicker platelets.']"," Yes, the study suggests that the use of a magnetizable implant such as a martensitic steel platelet can indeed increase the accumulation and retention capacity of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) in an area near the implant. This is achieved by increasing the strength of the externally applied magnetic field, which in turn facilitates the accumulation of MNPs. The study also indicates that the magnetized platelet can retain a higher amount of MNPs without an external magnetic field compared to a setup with no mounted platelet during flushing of the system. However, it's important to note that a higher flow velocity led to lower amounts of accumulated MNPs, and while not statistically significant, the magnetic field strength tended to increase with thicker platelets.",Yes. A martensitic steel platelet significantly improved the attachment of magnetic nanoparticles in an in vitro flow system and therewith indicates the potential of magnetic implant materials in orthopaedic surgery. The use of a remanent magnetic implant material could improve the efficiency of capturing MNPs especially when the external magnetic field is turned off thus facilitating and prolonging the effect. In this way higher drug levels in the target area might be attained resulting in lower inconveniences for the patient.,1,0.863306451,0.410848635
Is resection of residual disease after isolated limb infusion ( ILI ) equivalent to a complete response after ILI-alone in advanced extremity melanoma?,"['Isolated limb infusion (ILI) is a limb-preserving treatment for in-transit extremity melanoma.

Are not all mechanisms created equal : a single-center experience with the national guidelines for field triage of injured patients?,"[""Trauma systems use prehospital evaluation of anatomic and physiologic criteria and mechanism of injury (MOI) to determine trauma center need (TCN).

Controversy exists as to which MOI criteria truly predict TCN. We review our single-center experience with past and present National Trauma Triage Criteria to determine which MOI predict TCN.\nThe trauma registry of an urban Level I trauma center was reviewed from 2001 to 2011 for all patients meeting only MOI criteria. Patients meeting any anatomic and physiologic criteria were excluded. TCN was defined as death, Injury Severity Score (ISS) of greater than 15, emergency department transfusion, intensive care unit admission, need for laparotomy/thoracotomy/vascular surgery within 24 hours of arrival, pelvic fracture, 2 or more proximal long bone fractures, or neurosurgical intervention during admission. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify which MOI predict TCN.\nA total of 3,569 patients were transported to our trauma center who met only MOI criteria and had the MOI recorded in the registry; 821 MOI patients (23%) were identified who met our definition of TCN. Significant predictors of TCN included death in the same passenger compartment, ejection from vehicle, extrication time of more than 20 minutes, fall from more than 20 feet, and pedestrian thrown/runover. Criteria not meeting TCN include vehicle intrusion, rollover motor vehicle collision, speed of more than 40 mph, injury from autopedestrian/autobicycle of more than 5 mph, and both of the motorcycle crash (MCC) criteria.""]"," Based on this study, it appears that not all mechanisms of injury (MOI) predict the need for a trauma center equally.

Is susceptibility to motion sickness increased following spinal cord injury?,"[""There are two leading theories on the origin of motion sickness. One, the sensory conflict theory, states that sensory information provided by one sensory channel does not match the expected input from another channel; commonly, these two inputs originate in the vestibular system and the eyes.

Residual platelet activity assessed by adenosine diphosphate (20 micromol/L)-induced platelet aggregation was not significantly influenced by statin treatment. Nor the significant effects of CYP3A4-metabolization pathway on post-treatment aggregation were recorded, although there was even a trend to lower RPA values in patients treated with CYP3A4-metabolized statins. Further, in an inter-individual analysis comparing patients treated with CYP3A4- and non-CYP3A4-metabolized statins, no time-dependent difference of clopidogreÄºs anti-aggregatory effects was observed. Clinical follow-up of major adverse events (myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, death) in 991 patients within 3 months revealed no significant adverse effects of statin treatment on clinical outcome. Instead, statin treatment was independently associated with lower incidence of composite events (HR 0.44, 95% confidence interval 0.23-0.83, P = 0.01).']"," The study suggests that statins do not adversely affect post-interventional residual platelet aggregation and may even have a protective effect on clinical outcomes in patients undergoing coronary stenting treated by dual antiplatelet therapy. However, it's important to note that this is based on the findings of one specific study and more research may be needed to confirm these results. Always consult with a healthcare professional for medical advice.",No. Peri-procedural co-administration of statins does not increase the post-interventional RPA in cardiovascular patients treated with dual antiplatelet therapy and does not worsen the clinical prognosis of these patients.,0.6,0.821140189,0.792871831
Does response to intravenous immunoglobulin predict splenectomy response in children with immune thrombocytopenic purpura?,"['Response to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been shown to predict response to splenectomy in adults with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).

However, it's important to note that the specificity of response to IVIG as a predictor was 75%, meaning there is still a chance of false positives (patients who respond well to IVIG but not to splenectomy). The negative predictive value was 67%, indicating that if a patient does not respond well to IVIG, there is a 67% chance they will also not respond well to splenectomy.",Yes. These results suggest that response to IVIG is predictive of response to splenectomy in children with chronic ITP.

Do saccharomyces cerevisiae recA homologues RAD51 and DMC1 have both distinct and overlapping roles in meiotic recombination?,"['Rad51 and Dmc1 are Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologues of the Escherichia coli recombination protein RecA. Mutant analysis has shown that both proteins are required for normal meiotic recombination, for timely and efficient formation of synaptonemal complex and for normal progression out from meiotic prophase.\nWe have further characterized rad51 and dmc1 single mutants. A dmc1 mutation confers more severe defects in double strand break (DSB) resolution, crossover recombination and meiotic progression than does a rad51 mutant; in contrast, during return to growth, a rad51 mutation confers more severe defects in viability and intrachromosomal recombination than does a dmc1 mutation. Analysis of a rad51 dmc1 double mutant, in parallel with single mutants, shows that the double mutant is more defective with respect to the formation of crossovers during meiosis and, especially strikingly, with respect to interhomologue and intrachromosomal recombination during return to growth. Consistent with the observation of DMC1-dependent recombination in a rad51 mutant, subnuclear complexes of Dmc1 protein were detected for the first time in this mutant.

Does microRNA-18a inhibit hypoxia-inducible factor 1Î± activity and lung metastasis in basal breast cancers?,"[""In breast cancer, distinct expression profiles of microRNAs (miRNAs) have been associated with molecular subgroups and clinicopathological characteristics, implicating a diagnostic and prognostic role of miRNAs. However, the biological functions of deregulated miRNAs in tumor progression are not yet completely defined. In this study, we investigated the function of miR-18a in regulating breast cancer metastasis through the hypoxia-inducible factor 1Î± (HIF1A)-dependent hypoxic response.\nAn orthotopic metastatic breast cancer xenograft model (MDA-MB-231 cells) was used to identify miRNAs associated with spontaneous lung metastasis. The function of miR-18a in regulating HIF1A expression, as well as cellular responses to hypoxia and metastasis, were then studied in vitro and in vivo by assessing ectopic miR-18a expression or miR-18a inhibition. miRNA-mRNA interactions (AGO2 immunoprecipitation and 3' untranslated region Luciferase reporter assays), gene expression (quantitative PCR and microarray), cell migration and invasion, and cell growth were assessed under normoxic or hypoxic conditions, complemented by orthotopic xenograft of tumor cells to the mammary fat pad to investigate the effect of modulating miR-18a expression on primary tumor growth and lung metastasis. Last, clinically relevant correlations between miR-18a, HIF1A, hypoxia-responsive gene expression and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) were assessed using published expression array breast tumors data sets.\nmiRNAs encoded by the MIR17HG gene were downregulated in lung metastases compared to primary tumors. Ectopic expression of miR-18a, a MIR17HG family member, in a metastatic variant of MDA-MB-231 cells reduced primary tumor growth and lung metastasis, whereas miR-18a inhibition in the parental cells promoted tumor growth and lung metastasis. We identified HIF1A as a direct target of miR-18a. Modulating miR-18a expression significantly affected hypoxic gene expression, cell invasiveness and sensitivity to anoikis and hypoxia in vitro in a HIF1A-dependent manner. Analysis of previously published data revealed that higher expression of HIF1A and a panel of hypoxic genes is associated with shorter DMFS interval in patients with basal-like breast tumors, and that, within this subtype, miR-18a expression is inversely correlated with hypoxic gene expression.

Stimuli were normalized on dimensions of shape, size and luminance contrast distribution. To minimize task effects related to facial or emotional processing, facial stimuli were irrelevant to a primary task of learning associative pairings between a subsequently presented visual character and a spoken word.\nN170 to faces showed a strong modulation by emotional facial expression. A split half analysis demonstrates that this effect was significant both early and late in the experiment and was therefore not associated with only the initial exposures of these stimuli, demonstrating a form of robustness against habituation. The effect of emotional modulation of the N170 to faces did not show significant interaction with the gender of the face stimulus, or hemisphere of recording sites. Subtracting the fear versus neutral topography provided a topography that itself was highly similar to the face N170.']"," Yes, according to this study, the face-specific N170 component is modulated by emotional facial expression. The effect was significant both early and late in the experiment, indicating robustness against habituation. However, there was no significant interaction with the gender of the face stimulus or hemisphere of recording sites. The topography of the emotional modulation of the N170 to faces was similar to the typical face N170 topography.","Yes. The face N170 response can be influenced by emotional expressions contained within facial stimuli. The topography of this effect is consistent with the notion that fear stimuli exaggerates the N170 response itself. This finding stands in contrast to previous models suggesting that N170 processes linked to structural analysis of faces precede analysis of emotional expression, and instead may reflect early top-down modulation from neural systems involved in rapid emotional processing.",1,0.878700633,0.628019234
Does complex expression pattern of RPGR reveal a role for purine-rich exonic splicing enhancers?,"['To examine the mechanism underlying transcript heterogeneity in the gene for the retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator (RPGR).\nTranscript heterogeneity was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR), rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), and transient expression of minigene constructs. Protein variants were identified by immunoblot analysis and by immunocytochemistry.\nRPGR transcripts terminated either uniformly at the end of exon 19, producing the constitutive transcript with few variants, or at variable sites downstream from exon 15. The latter transcripts resembled the previously described open reading frame (ORF)14/15 variant, but the ORF14/15 exon was not found in full length. Instead, various portions of a purine-rich region were removed as introns. Numerous splice site combinations were used, giving rise to innumerable variants. Analysis of the purine-rich region found multiple exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) known to promote splicing through interaction with serine-arginine repeat (SR) proteins. Antibodies targeting different regions of RPGR detected a multitude of RPGR proteins in photoreceptors, concentrated in the connecting cilium. Predominant ORF14/15-encoded RPGR polypeptides migrated at approximately 200 kDa and were photoreceptor specific.']"," Yes, the complex expression pattern of RPGR suggests a role for purine-rich exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) in promoting alternative splicing. The presence of multiple ESEs within the purine-rich region of RPGR and the use of numerous splice site combinations result in various transcript variants, including the ORF14/15 variant. Additionally, the predominant ORF14/15-encoded RPGR polypeptides are photoreceptor specific, further supporting a role for ESEs in regulating RPGR expression in this tissue.",Yes. The exceptional heterogeneity in RPGR transcript processing results primarily from a novel form of alternative RNA splicing mediated by multiple exonic splicing enhancers. RPGR is composed of a population of proteins with a constant N-terminal core encompassing the RCC1 homology domain followed by a C-terminal portion of variable lengths and sequences.,1,0.87446018,0.548265636
Does administration of vitamin D3 improve antimetastatic efficacy of cancer vaccine therapy of Lewis lung carcinoma?,"['To analyze antitumor efficacy of experimental cancer vaccine therapy combined with introduction of vitamin D3 (VD3) for treatment of Lewis lung carcinoma (3LL).\nCancer vaccines composed from recombinant murine beta-defensin-2 (mBD-2) and 3LL cell lysate, or DNA, coding for mBD-2-Muc1 fusion construct cloned in pcDNA3+ vector, were prepared and used for intradermal vaccination.

We hypothesized that a battery of such TCD findings would have a greater sensitivity than any one TCD finding alone and would have clinical utility in identifying carotid disease.\nWe determined the prevalence of seven TCD findings in patients with various degrees of carotid stenosis as measured by a blinded observer on 138 cerebral angiograms. We further determined the sensitivity and specificity of any one finding or any single abnormality in the TCD battery (the combination of all seven findings) for identifying severe (> or = 70%) carotid stenosis by angiography.\nThe following four individual TCD findings were associated (P < .001) with > or = 70% carotid stenosis on cerebral angiography: ophthalmic and anterior cerebral artery flow reversal and low middle cerebral artery flow acceleration and pulsatility. The presence of any single abnormality in the TCD battery had a similar association (P < .001) with > or = 70% carotid stenosis. The individual TCD findings had sensitivities of 3% to 83% and specificities of 60% to 100% for identifying > or = 70% carotid stenosis. The TCD battery had a sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 42% for identifying > or = 70% carotid stenosis.']," Yes, the transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) battery can reliably identify severe internal carotid artery stenosis (> or = 70%) with a sensitivity of 95%. However, it should be noted that while the TCD battery has a high sensitivity, its specificity is relatively low at 42%. This means that while the test is good at identifying those with severe carotid stenosis, it may also produce false positives. As such, further diagnostic tests may be required for confirmation in cases where the TCD battery indicates severe carotid stenosis.",Yes. A battery of TCD findings that can be routinely measured reliably identified patients with > or = 70% angiographic internal carotid artery stenosis with high sensitivity.,1,0.894765512,0.200471243
Is a genetic code alteration a phenotype diversity generator in the human pathogen Candida albicans?,"[""The discovery of genetic code alterations and expansions in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes abolished the hypothesis of a frozen and universal genetic code and exposed unanticipated flexibility in codon and amino acid assignments. It is now clear that codon identity alterations involve sense and non-sense codons and can occur in organisms with complex genomes and proteomes. However, the biological functions, the molecular mechanisms of evolution and the diversity of genetic code alterations remain largely unknown. In various species of the genus Candida, the leucine CUG codon is decoded as serine by a unique serine tRNA that contains a leucine 5'-CAG-3'anticodon (tRNA(CAG)(Ser)). We are using this codon identity redefinition as a model system to elucidate the evolution of genetic code alterations.\nWe have reconstructed the early stages of the Candida genetic code alteration by engineering tRNAs that partially reverted the identity of serine CUG codons back to their standard leucine meaning. Such genetic code manipulation had profound cellular consequences as it exposed important morphological variation, altered gene expression, re-arranged the karyotype, increased cell-cell adhesion and secretion of hydrolytic enzymes.""]"," Yes, a genetic code alteration can act as a generator for phenotype diversity in the human pathogen Candida albicans. The alteration of the leucine CUG codon to serine by a unique tRNA(CAG)(Ser) has been shown to result in significant cellular consequences such as morphological variation, altered gene expression, karyotype rearrangement, increased cell-cell adhesion, and secretion of hydrolytic enzymes. These changes represent phenotypic diversity generated by the genetic code alteration in this organism.",Yes. Our study provides the first experimental evidence for an important role of genetic code alterations as generators of phenotypic diversity of high selective potential and supports the hypothesis that they speed up evolution of new phenotypes.,1,0.808122348,0.383116568

Does a new decoding algorithm for hidden Markov models improve the prediction of the topology of all-beta membrane proteins?,"['Structure prediction of membrane proteins is still a challenging computational problem. Hidden Markov models (HMM) have been successfully applied to the problem of predicting membrane protein topology. In a predictive task, the HMM is endowed with a decoding algorithm in order to assign the most probable state path, and in turn the labels, to an unknown sequence. The Viterbi and the posterior decoding algorithms are the most common. The former is very efficient when one path dominates, while the latter, even though does not guarantee to preserve the HMM grammar, is more effective when several concurring paths have similar probabilities. A third good alternative is 1-best, which was shown to perform equal or better than Viterbi.\nIn this paper we introduce the posterior-Viterbi (PV) a new decoding which combines the posterior and Viterbi algorithms.

The study shows that DBS collection and mailing to the lab for testing was feasible at these sites, with a high percentage (98.6%) of specimens tested successfully. Additionally, the results from DBS were comparable to those from venous blood specimens in terms of positivity rate (85.1% vs 78.6%). This suggests that using DBS for confirmation at non-clinical HIV rapid testing sites could be a practical solution for venues with limited capacity to collect venous blood. However, it's important to note that there were still some unsatisfactory specimens and indeterminate results, which may need to be addressed in future studies or improvements in the DBS collection process.","Yes. Compared to venous blood, the percentage of rapid test referral specimens with a positive Western blot was significantly greater for DBS specimens and the frequency of unsatisfactory specimens did not differ significantly. These results indicate that DBS are a suitable alternative to venous blood for confirmation of HIV rapid tests conducted at non-clinical sites.",0.8,0.911690216,
Is systemic and pulmonary inflammation independent of skeletal muscle changes in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease?,"['Nutritional depletion is an important manifestation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which has been related to systemic inflammation. It remains unclear to what degree airway inflammation contributes to the presence or progression of nutritional depletion.\nTo determine whether airway inflammation and lung bacterial colonization are related to nutritional status or predict progressive weight loss and muscle atrophy in patients with COPD.\nBody composition using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, indices of airway inflammation, and bacterial colonization were measured in 234 COPD patients. Systemic inflammation was assessed from serum C reactive protein (CRP) and circulating total and differential leukocyte counts. Nutritional depletion was defined as a body mass index (BMI) less than 21 kg/m(2) and/or fat-free mass index (FFMI) less than 15 or 17 kg/m(2) in women and men, respectively. FFMI was calculated as the fat-free mass (FFM) corrected for body surface area. Measurements were repeated in 94 patients after a median 16-month follow-up. Regression analysis was used to assess the relationships of weight change and FFM change with indices of bacterial colonization and airway and systemic inflammation.\nNutritional depletion occurred in 37% of patients. Lung function was worsened in patients with nutritional depletion compared to those without (forced expiratory volume in 1 second 1.17 L versus 1.41 L, mean difference 0.24, 95% confidence interval 0.10 to 0.38, P<0.01). There were no differences in airway inflammation and bacterial colonization in patients with and without nutritional depletion. At baseline, BMI correlated positively with serum CRP (rs=0.14, P=0.04). Change in weight and change in FFM over time could not be predicted from baseline patient characteristics.']"," Based on the study provided, it appears that there is a correlation between systemic inflammation (as indicated by serum C-reactive protein levels) and nutritional depletion in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Does spreading depression induce permanent cell swelling under penumbra conditions?,"['Spreading depression (SD) is known to go along with temporary breakdown of ion gradients and cell swelling which spontaneously normalizes. Here, the effects of SD at reduced flow conditions as encountered in the ischemic penumbra are examined.\nIn rats the right carotid artery was permanently occluded. MABP was lowered to 50 mmHg for 30 min. This is sufficient to reduce CBF to penumbra-like conditions in the right hemisphere. The following parameters were assessed: rCBF, DC potential, and tissue impedance. 5 or 15 min after onset of flow reduction one SD wave was initiated by microinjection of KCl. Histology was performed after 7 days.\nIn animals with hypotension there was depolarization resembling anoxic depolarization after SD induction and an uncoupling of CBF and metabolism only in the right hemisphere. Impedance increased with SD but did not recover spontaneously as long as rCBF remained reduced. 15 min of SD-induced cell swelling was tolerated without permanent damage, whereas 25 min were followed by severe neuron loss in the affected cortex after 7 days.']","15 minutes of spreading depression (SD) under penumbra conditions did not cause permanent cell swelling or damage, but 25 minutes of SD resulted in severe neuron loss in the affected cortex after 7 days.",Yes.

Does iL-18 neutralization during alveolar hypoxia improve left ventricular diastolic function in mice?,"['In patients, an association exists between pulmonary diseases and diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle (LV). We have previously shown that alveolar hypoxia in mice induces LV diastolic dysfunction and that mice exposed to hypoxia have increased levels of circulating interleukin-18 (IL-18), suggesting involvement of IL-18 in development of diastolic dysfunction. IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP) is a natural inhibitor of IL-18. In this study, we hypothesized that neutralization of IL-18 during alveolar hypoxia would improve LV diastolic function.\nMice were exposed to 10% oxygen for 2 weeks while treated with IL-18BP or vehicle. Cardiac function and morphology were measured using echocardiography, intraventricular pressure measurements and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). For characterization of molecular changes in the heart, both real-time PCR and Western blotting were performed. ELISA technique was used to measure levels of circulating cytokines.\nAs expected, exposure to hypoxia-induced LV diastolic dysfunction, as shown by prolonged time constant of isovolumic relaxation (Ï„). Improved relaxation with IL-18BP treatment was demonstrated by a significant reduction towards control Ï„ values. Decreased levels of phosphorylated phospholamban (P-PLB) in hypoxia, but normalization by IL-18BP treatment suggest a role for IL-18 in regulation of calcium-handling proteins in hypoxia-induced diastolic dysfunction.

Results Responses were reviewed and categorized descriptively. Five general environment topics of focus emerged: privacy, space, noise, light, and overall atmosphere. Characteristics perceived as being dissatisfying and satisfying are discussed.""]"," In this study, hospitalized patients and their families who were primarily in intensive care and step-down units were surveyed to determine their perceptions of evidence-based design features in a new heart center and assess their satisfaction with the environment. The five general environment topics of focus were privacy, space, noise, light, and overall atmosphere. Characteristics perceived as dissatisfying and satisfying for each topic are discussed below:

1. Privacy: Patients and families expressed concerns about lack of privacy in semi-private rooms, shared bathrooms, and limited control over their surroundings. On the other hand, they appreciated having a family member stay overnight and the presence of visual screens to provide privacy when needed.

2. Space: Some patients felt cramped in their rooms, while others appreciated the spaciousness of the overall facility. The availability of storage space for personal belongings was also noted as important.

3. Noise: Patients reported that noise from other patients, staff, and equipment was a significant issue, causing stress and difficulty sleeping. However, they appreciated the use of headphones to listen to music or watch TV without disturbing others.

4. Light: Many patients expressed dissatisfaction with the amount and quality of natural light in their rooms, as well as the brightness of artificial lighting during nighttime hours. On the positive side, they appreciated the ability to adjust room lighting levels.

5. Overall Atmosphere: Patients and families generally felt that the new heart center had a welcoming and calming atmosphere, with modern design elements and artwork contributing positively to their experience. However, they also noted concerns about the sterile appearance of some areas and the lack of personalization in patient rooms.

In summary, this study highlights the importance of considering patients' and families' perceptions when designing evidence-based hospital environments. While there were some dissatisfying aspects related to privacy, space, noise, light, and overall atmosphere, many patients appreciated certain design features that contributed to their satisfaction with the environment. These findings can help guide future hospital design efforts to create more patient-centered spaces that promote healing and wellbeing.","Yes. Critical care nurses must be aware of the current need to recognize how much the physical environment influences care delivery and take steps to maximize patients' safety, satisfaction, and quality of care.",0.933333333,0.614680262,
Is hypospadias related to birth weight in discordant monozygotic twins?,"['Hypospadias is a common urogenital malformation in boys.

Are chefs ' attitudes toward healthful food preparation more positive than their food science knowledge and practices?,"[""To determine if chefs' and student chefs' attitudes, knowledge, and practices regarding healthful food preparation are consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.\nAn analytical survey questionnaire was distributed to 4 chef groups. Sections 1 and 2 of the survey measured chefs' food science knowledge (13 questions) and likelihood of using food preparation practices (15 questions) necessary to meet the 1990 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Section 3 (22 questions) measured chefs' attitudes toward nutrition in general, toward the importance of healthful food preparation practices, and toward the US Dietary Guidelines.\nOf 512 surveys distributed by mail, at culinary meetings, and in classes at 2 culinary schools, 447 (86%) were returned (158 from practicing chefs and 289 from student chefs). Practicing chefs included chef educators, foodservice chefs from a national corporation, and independent chef members of the American Culinary Federation of New York City.\nDescriptive statistics included frequencies, means, and standard deviations of survey items and of individual survey sections. Reliability and validity were determined using alpha coefficients and principal components analysis. Analysis of variance was used to examine differences in practice, attitudes, and knowledge among chef groups.\nBoth practicing chefs and student chefs answered more than 70% of the food science questions correctly; independent chefs scored significantly lower than educator and corporate chefs. More than two thirds of the chefs and student chefs correctly responded to questions about the nutrient composition of food and how cooking affects the nutrient content of food. All chef groups were confused about fat and cholesterol in food and in the body. Few healthful food preparation practices were likely to be used by any chef group more than two thirds of the time, although the subscale of the attitude toward the importance of these practices was very positive.

Rats in group SI were sham injured without fluid resuscitation. Rats in the latter 3 groups were inflicted with 30% TBSA full-thickness scald (referred to as burn below) on the back and intraperitoneally injected with 40 mL/kg balanced salt solution immediately after injury. Rats in groups SH and PPG were respectively intraperitoneally injected with SH (56 Âµmol/kg) and PPG (45 mg/kg) within 1 hour post injury.

The speed at which individual CFTR channels are inhibited also varies among these loop diuretics, with furosemide blocking very quickly and overlapping brief channel closures, whereas piretanide inhibits channels at an intermediate speed and drug-induced blocking events are distinct from channel closures.","Yes. Structure-activity analysis of the loop diuretics suggests that the phenoxy group present in bumetanide and piretanide, but absent in furosemide and xipamide, might account for the different kinetics of channel block by locking loop diuretics within the intracellular vestibule of the CFTR pore. We conclude that loop diuretics are open-channel blockers of CFTR with distinct kinetics, affected by molecular dimensions and lipophilicity.",,0.616455807,0.454222863
Is luteal-phase ovarian stimulation a feasible method for poor ovarian responders undergoing in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection-embryo transfer treatment compared to a GnRH antagonist protocol : A retrospective study?,"['Poor ovarian response to ovarian hyperstimulation is one of the biggest challenges in assisted reproduction technology. Although many stimulation protocols have been established to improve clinical outcomes in poor ovarian responders (PORs), which protocol is the most effective remains controversial. Luteal-phase ovarian stimulation (LPOS) has been used in normal ovarian responders with satisfactory outcomes. However, the efficacy of LPOS in PORs is unclear. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of LPOS and GnRH antagonist (GnRH-ant) in PORs.\nThe clinical parameters in PORs who received LPOS (50 cycles in 39 patients) or GnRH-ant (158 cycles in 123 patients) were compared.\nCompared with those in the GnRH-ant group, the PORs in the LPOS group showed significantly fewer basal antral follicles (3.1 Â± 2.2 vs. 4.1 Â± 1.6, p < 0.001) and a higher in vitro fertilization rate. There were no significant differences in the numbers of retrieved oocytes and D3 transferable embryos between the two groups. However, the pregnancy rate in the LPOS group (46.4%) was significantly higher than that in the GnRH-ant group (25.8% overall; 22.9% from fresh embryos and 29.6% from frozen embryos). Moreover, 23 PORs in the LPOS group underwent oocyte retrieval twice in one cycle, and the numbers of retrieved oocytes and transferable embryos from the luteal phase were significantly higher than those from the follicular phase in the same menstrual cycle.']"," Based on the information provided, it appears that the study found that luteal-phase ovarian stimulation (LPOS) may be a more effective method for poor ovarian responders undergoing in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection-embryo transfer treatment compared to a GnRH antagonist protocol. The LPOS group showed a higher in vitro fertilization rate, a higher pregnancy rate (both fresh and frozen embryos), and a significantly higher number of retrieved oocytes and transferable embryos from the luteal phase compared to the follicular phase in the same menstrual cycle. However, it's important to note that this is a retrospective study, which means that the data was collected after the events occurred rather than during, and there may be some biases or confounding factors that were not accounted for in the analysis. Therefore, more research, ideally prospective studies, would be needed to confirm these findings and further explore the potential benefits and limitations of LPOS in poor ovarian responders.","Yes. Compared with the GnRH-ant protocol, the LPOS protocol may be a better regime for PORs that can increase the numbers of retrieved oocytes and transferable embryos as well as the pregnancy rate.",0.875,0.745083176,0.64971754

Does the neuropeptide secretoneurin act as a direct angiogenic cytokine in vitro and in vivo?,"[""Secretoneurin is an abundant neuropeptide of the central, peripheral, and autonomic nervous systems, located in nerve fibers characterized by a close interaction with blood vessels and known to stimulate endothelial cell migration.\nWe hypothesized that secretoneurin might act as an angiogenic cytokine and tested for these effects in vivo using a mouse cornea neovascularization model and in vitro by assessing capillary tube formation in a matrigel assay. In vivo, secretoneurin-induced neovasculature is characterized by a distinct pattern of arterial and venous vessels of large diameter and length. Immunohistochemical staining for CD-31 revealed endothelial lining of the inner surface of these vessels, and recruitment of alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive perivascular cells suggests vessel maturation. In vitro, secretoneurin-induced capillary tube formation was dose dependent and specific, confirming that effects of secretoneurin occur directly on endothelial cells.

Are erythropoietin levels independently associated with malaria-attributable severe disease in Mozambican children?,"['Severe malaria is difficult to differentiate from other forms of malaria or other infections with similar symptoms. Any parameter associated to malaria-attributable severe disease could help to improve severe malaria diagnosis.\nThis study assessed the relation between erythropoietin (EPO) and malaria-attributable severe disease in an area of Mozambique with moderate malaria transmission. 211 children <5 years, recruited at ManhiÃ§a District Hospital or in the surrounding villages, were included in one of the following groups: severe malaria (SM, nâ€Š=â€Š44), hospital malaria without severity (HM, nâ€Š=â€Š49), uncomplicated malaria (UM, nâ€Š=â€Š47), invasive bacterial infection without malaria parasites (IBI, nâ€Š=â€Š39) and healthy community controls (C, nâ€Š=â€Š32). Malaria was diagnosed by microscopy and IBI by blood/cerebrospinal fluid culture.\nMean EPO concentration in the control group was 20.95 U/l (SDâ€Š=â€Š2.96 U/l).

Is liver X receptor signaling a determinant of stellate cell activation and susceptibility to fibrotic liver disease?,"['Liver X receptors (LXRs) are lipid-activated nuclear receptors with important roles in cholesterol transport, lipogenesis, and anti-inflammatory signaling. Hepatic stellate cells activate during chronic liver injury and mediate the fibrotic response. These cells are also major repositories for lipids, but the role of lipid metabolism during stellate cell activation remains unclear. We investigated the role of LXR signaling stellate cell activation and susceptibility to fibrotic liver disease.\nImmortalized and primary stellate cells purified from mice were treated with highly specific LXR ligands. Carbon tetrachloride and methionine/choline deficiency were used as chronic liver injury models. Reciprocal bone marrow transplants were performed to test the importance of hematopoietically derived cells to the fibrotic response.\nLXR ligands suppressed markers of fibrosis and stellate cell activation in primary mouse stellate cells. LxrÎ±Î²(-/-) stellate cells produce increased levels of inflammatory mediators, and conditioned media from LxrÎ±Î²(-/-) cells increases the fibrogenic program of wild-type cells. Furthermore, LxrÎ±Î²(-/-) stellate cells exhibit altered lipid morphology and increased expression of fibrogenic genes, suggesting they are primed for activation. In vivo, LxrÎ±Î²(-/-) mice have marked susceptibility to fibrosis in 2 injury models. Bone marrow transplants point to altered stellate cell function, rather than hematopoietic cell inflammation, as the primary basis for the LxrÎ±Î²(-/-) phenotype.']"," Yes, liver X receptor (LXR) signaling appears to be a determinant of stellate cell activation and susceptibility to fibrotic liver disease.

In vivo, LxrÎ±Î²(-/-) mice have marked susceptibility to fibrosis in 2 injury models. These findings suggest that LXR signaling plays a crucial role in regulating stellate cell function and the fibrotic response in liver disease.",Yes.

Does zP120 cause relaxation by pre-junctional inhibition of noradrenergic neurotransmission in rat mesenteric resistance arteries?,"['ZP120 (Ac-RYYRWKKKKKKK-NH(2)), is a new partial nociceptin/orphanin FQ (NOP) receptor agonist with sodium-potassium sparing aquaretic effects. The mechanisms of vasodilatation of ZP120 were examined in rat mesenteric resistance arteries.\nArterial segments (internal diameters 206+/-4 microm, n=224) were mounted in microvascular myographs for isometric tension recordings and electrical field stimulation (EFS).\nZP120 and the endogenous NOP receptor ligand, N/OFQ, did not relax arteries contracted with noradrenaline or adenosine-triphosphate. EFS-evoked contractions were inhibited by a purinoceptor antagonist, suramin, and the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin. N/OFQ inhibited, concentration-dependently, EFS-evoked contractions with a maximal effect of 52+/-3% (n=8) at 1 microM. The maximal effect of 1 microM ZP120 was lower (27+/-5%, P<0.05, n=9) than for N/OFQ. Endothelial removal or pretreatment with capsaicin did not influence the vasodilator effects of ZP120 and N/OFQ. ZP120 and N/OFQ responses were preserved in the presence of suramin. The alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist, rauwolscine, antagonized the effect of clonidine and brimonidine, but ZP120 and N/OFQ inhibition of EFS-evoked contraction was unaltered. The competitive NOP receptor antagonist, UFP-101 (10 microM), prevented the inhibitory effect of N/OFQ, but not ZP120 suggesting that N/OFQ and ZP120 have distinct modes of interaction with the NOP receptor.']"," Based on the provided data, it appears that ZP120 causes relaxation in rat mesenteric resistance arteries, but not through pre-junctional inhibition of noradrenergic neurotransmission. Instead, ZP120 seems to act on the NOP receptor, as its effects are prevented by a competitive NOP receptor antagonist (UFP-101), while it is unaffected by an alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist (rauwolscine) that would typically block pre-junctional inhibition of noradrenergic neurotransmission. The mechanisms of ZP120's vasodilatation may be distinct from those of the endogenous NOP receptor ligand, N/OFQ.","Yes. Our findings suggest that the vasodilator effect of ZP120 and N/OFQ in rat mesenteric resistance arteries is mediated by prejunctional inhibition of adrenergic neurotransmission. These properties, that promote diuresis and attenuate the cardiovascular consequences of increased sympathetic nerve activity, make ZP120 a promising drug candidate.",0.833333333,0.508167221,0.505550446

However, it's important to note that this is just one study, and more research may be needed to fully understand the potential effects of EMF on various cell types and biological processes.","No. In conclusion, EMF do not seem to be able to interfere with the biochemical properties of FRTL-5 cells in vitro.",0.666666667,0.389666346,0.741292843
Is hysteroscopy superior to hysterosalpingography in infertility investigation?,"['The development of advanced endoscopic instrumentation in recent years has demonstrated the superiority of direct visual examination over radiographic demonstration of various body cavities. Just as laparoscopy has gradually taken a primary role in the surgical investigation of the ovulatory infertile patient, the role of intrauterine endoscopy in comparison to hysterosalpingography (HSG) needs to be reevaluated.\nFour hundred and sixty-four infertile women had undergone both hysterosalpingography and a diagnostic hysteroscopy and the findings were analysed.\nCompared to hysteroscopy the sensitivity of HSG was 98%, but its specificity only 15%, the positive predictive value 45%, and negative predictive value 95%. On hysteroscopy a normal uterine cavity was found in 53% of the cases with a filling defect and in 56% of those with uterine wall irregularity on HSG.']"," Based on the data provided, it appears that hysteroscopy is more specific (15%) than hysterosalpingography (98%) in infertility investigation. However, it should be noted that hysteroscopy also has a higher positive predictive value (45%) compared to HSG. This suggests that when an abnormality is detected by hysteroscopy, there is a higher likelihood that it is indeed present. On the other hand, when an abnormality is detected by HSG, there is a lower probability that it is actually present.

In terms of sensitivity, HSG (98%) appears to be superior to hysteroscopy (53% for filling defects and 56% for uterine wall irregularity). This means that when an abnormality exists, HSG is more likely to detect it compared to hysteroscopy.

In conclusion, while both methods have their strengths and weaknesses, the data suggests that hysteroscopy may be more specific in identifying true abnormalities, but HSG may be more sensitive in detecting existing abnormalities. The choice between the two methods might depend on the specific clinical context and the preferences of the healthcare provider and patient.","Yes. Hysteroscopy, a safe and rapid direct visualisation of the uterine cavity, is superior to HSG in the identification of intrauterine pathology.

Is anti-nociception mediated by a Îº opioid receptor agonist blocked by a Î´ receptor agonist?,"['The opioid receptor family comprises four structurally homologous but functionally distinct sub-groups, the Î¼ (MOP), Î´ (DOP), Îº (KOP) and nociceptin (NOP) receptors. As most opioid agonists are selective but not specific, a broad spectrum of behaviours due to activation of different opioid receptors is expected. In this study, we examine whether other opioid receptor systems influenced KOP-mediated antinociception.\nWe used a tail withdrawal assay in C57Bl/6 mice to assay the antinociceptive effect of systemically administered opioid agonists with varying selectivity at KOP receptors. Pharmacological and genetic approaches were used to analyse the interactions of the other opioid receptors in modulating KOP-mediated antinociception.\nEtorphine, a potent agonist at all four opioid receptors, was not anti-nociceptive in MOP knockout (KO) mice, although etorphine is an efficacious KOP receptor agonist and specific KOP receptor agonists remain analgesic in MOP KO mice. As KOP receptor agonists are aversive, we considered KOP-mediated antinociception might be a form of stress-induced analgesia that is blocked by the anxiolytic effects of DOP receptor agonists. In support of this hypothesis, pretreatment with the DOP antagonist, naltrindole (10â€‰mgÂ·kg(-1) ), unmasked etorphine (3â€‰mgÂ·kg(-1) ) antinociception in MOP KO mice.

Does genetic variation in taste receptor pseudogenes provide evidence for a dynamic role in human evolution?,"['Human bitter taste receptors are encoded by a gene family consisting of 25 functional TAS2R loci. In addition, humans carry 11 TAS2R pseudogenes, some of which display evidence for substantial diversification among species, showing lineage-specific loss of function. Since bitter taste is thought to help prevent the intake of toxic substances, diversity at TAS2R genes could reflect the action of natural selection on the ability to recognize some bitter compounds rather than others. Whether species-specific variation in TAS2R pseudogenes is solely the result of genetic drift or whether it may have been influenced by selection due to different feeding behaviors has been an open question.\nIn this study, we analyzed patterns of variation at human TAS2R pseudogenes in both African and non-African populations, and compared them to those observable in nonhuman primates and archaic human species. Our results showed a similar worldwide distribution of allelic variation for most of the pseudogenes, with the exception of the TAS2R6P and TAS2R18P loci, both of which presented an unexpected higher frequency of derived alleles outside Africa. At the TAS2R6P locus, two SNPs were found in strong linkage disequilibrium (r2â€‰>â€‰0.9) with variants in the functional TAS2R5 gene, which showed signatures of selection. The human TAS2R18P carried a species-specific stop-codon upstream of four polymorphic insertions in the reading frame. SNPs at this locus showed significant positive values in a number of neutrality statistics, and age estimates indicated that they arose after the homo-chimp divergence.']"," Yes, the study provides evidence for a dynamic role in human evolution as it shows that variation in certain TAS2R pseudogenes (specifically TAS2R6P and TAS2R18P) is not solely due to genetic drift but may have been influenced by selection.

Furthermore, the species-specific stop-codon and polymorphic insertions in the reading frame of TAS2R18P, along with its post-divergence age estimate, further support this conclusion.","Yes. The similar distribution of variation of many human bitter receptor pseudogenes among human populations suggests that they arose from the ancestral forms by a unidirectional loss of function. However we explain the higher frequency of TAS2R6P derived alleles outside Africa as the effect of the balancing selection acting on the closely linked TAS2R5 gene. In contrast, TAS2R18P displayed a more complex history, suggesting an acquired function followed by a recent pseudogenization that predated the divergence of human modern and archaic species, which we hypothesize was associated with adaptions to dietary changes.",1,0.510048807,0.585426556

The study also found that hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection was present in 25.9% of PCT patients, but none of these patients carried the C282Y mutation. This suggests that HCV infection may not act independently as a cofactor for PCT in this population.

In terms of biochemical markers, both groups (homozygous normal and heterozygous for the C282Y mutation) had higher mean transferrin saturation and serum ferritin concentrations than healthy controls, but these values were similar within the PCT group.

In conclusion, while both the C282Y mutation in HFE and HCV infection can contribute to the development of PCT, they seem to act independently in this Australian patient population. However, further studies are needed to confirm these findings and explore potential interactions between these factors.","Yes. The raised frequency of the C282Y mutation in porphyria cutanea tarda indicates that this mutation is likely to be a predisposing factor.

In silico analyses were used to probe the association between gene expression signatures for RB loss and chromosomal instability and the ability of genes up-regulated by RB loss to predict the survival of human HCC patients.\nRB deficiency significantly increased tumor multiplicity in livers exposed to DEN. Although hepatocytes in nontumor regions of DEN-exposed livers were quiescent regardless of RB status, tumors arising in RB-deficient livers were significantly more proliferative than those in normal livers and expressed high levels of RB/E2F target genes. Analysis of genes up-regulated by RB loss demonstrated significant overlap with a gene expression signature associated with chromosomal instability. Correspondingly, tumors arising in RB-deficient livers were significantly more likely to harbor hepatocytes exhibiting altered ploidy. Finally, gene expression analysis of human HCCs demonstrated that elevated expression of RB-regulated genes independently predicts poor survival.']"," Yes, the loss of retinoblastoma (RB) appears to abrogate cell cycle control and genome integrity, promoting liver tumorigenesis. This is evident from the increased tumor multiplicity observed in mice with liver-specific RB ablation when exposed to diethylnitrosamine (DEN), as well as the higher proliferation rates and altered ploidy of tumors arising in RB-deficient livers compared to wild-type livers. Additionally, genes up-regulated by RB loss significantly overlap with a gene expression signature associated with chromosomal instability. Furthermore, elevated expression of RB-regulated genes independently predicts poor survival in human HCC patients.","Yes. RB deletion in the mouse liver enhances DEN-induced tumorigenesis, associated with increased hepatocyte proliferation and compromised genome integrity.

Do adverse events outweigh benefits of combination therapy for Crohn 's disease in a decision analytic model?,"[""The Study of Biologic and Immunomodulator-NaÃ¯ve Patients With Crohn's Disease (SONIC) showed that combination therapy with infliximab and azathioprine (IFX/AZA) is more effective than treatment with IFX alone. Numbers and types of adverse events were roughly equivalent among groups, although enrollment was limited, so it was not clear how rare adverse events might affect overall outcomes in practice. We sought to define the frequency at which a rare adverse event would have to occur for the risks of combination therapy to outweigh the benefits of treatment.\nWe constructed a decision model to compare the risks and benefits of IFX/AZA with IFX monotherapy. Model parameters were taken from SONIC and other published literature. The base-case analysis was patients with active Crohn's disease who are naÃ¯ve to both medications (similar to those in SONIC) who were treated for 1 year. We used sensitivity analyses to determine the thresholds at which the risks of side effects from IFX/AZA outweigh its benefits.\nDuring 1 year, the benefits of IFX/AZA would outweigh the risks, unless serious infections occurred in 20% or more of the population or lymphoma in 3.9% or more. These thresholds are 5-fold and 65-fold higher than base-case estimates, respectively.""]"," In the context of your question, the decision analytic model suggests that for adverse events to outweigh the benefits of combination therapy (IFX/AZA) in treating Crohn's disease, serious infections would have to occur in at least 20% of the population, and lymphoma would have to occur in at least 3.9% of the population. These thresholds are significantly higher than the base-case estimates, indicating that the benefits of IFX/AZA therapy outweigh the risks under normal circumstances. However, it's important to note that these findings are based on a model and may not reflect real-world scenarios due to factors such as individual patient variability and rare adverse events.","No. On the basis of data from 1 year of SONIC, the combination of IFX/AZA was more effective than IFX alone in patients with Crohn's disease who are naÃ¯ve to either drug.

Does the valine allele of the V89L polymorphism in the 5-alpha-reductase gene confer a reduced risk for hypospadias?,"['Hypospadias is one of the most common malformations in man, with an incidence of 1:300 in newborn boys. No gene has been identified that causes isolated hypospadias, but the androgenic influence is important during male genital development.\nA key enzyme for the androgenic function is steroid 5-alpha-reductase (SRD5A2). The V89L polymorphism in the SRD5A2 gene has been studied and found to be of functional importance. The leucine version of the enzyme is 30% less efficient than the valine variant. DESIGN, SETTING, PATIENTS, AND RESULTS: We have genotyped 158 hypospadias cases and 96 unaffected controls for this polymorphism and found a significant negative association for the V89 allele in hypospadias (odds ratio, 0.24; 95% confidence interval, 0.14-0.41 for homozygous individuals). This indicates that a fully functional 5-alpha-reductase enzyme (homozygous for V89) protects the male urethral development. This association is shown regardless of heredity, ethnicity, and severity of phenotype. We have also sequenced a selected material of 37 sporadic cases of more severe hypospadias for mutations in the androgen receptor AR, SRD5A2, and 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase HSD17B3 genes and found only two previously described mutations, one in the AR and one in the SRD5A2 gene.']"," Yes, the valine allele of the V89L polymorphism in the 5-alpha-reductase gene appears to confer a reduced risk for hypospadias.

Does deregulation of PERK in the autoimmune disease pemphigus vulgaris occur via IgG-independent mechanisms?,"['Serum and IgG isolated from patients with the autoimmune blistering disease pemphigus vulgaris (PV) trigger complex intracellular pathways in keratinocytes, including alterations of the cell cycle and metabolism, which ultimately lead to cell-cell detachment (acantholysis).

Decreased expression of PERK by siRNA reduced the effects of PV serum on the cell cycle and keratinocyte viability, two key events in PV pathophysiology. As impairment of metabolic activity in PV is partially due to non-IgG serum factors, we then investigated the activation of PERK in keratinocytes incubated with whole PV serum, purified PV IgG and IgG-depleted PV serum. The data demonstrated that PV sera depleted of IgG, but not PV IgG, triggered PERK phosphorylation and this correlated with a marked reduction of metabolic activity in keratinocytes exposed to IgG-free serum. Knockdown of PERK by siRNA abrogated the changes in the cell cycle and apoptosis induced by IgG-depleted PV serum.

Is endothelial dysfunction a potential contributor to multiple organ failure and mortality in aged mice subjected to septic shock : preclinical studies in a murine model of cecal ligation and puncture?,"['The goal of the current study was to investigate the effect of aging on the development of endothelial dysfunction in a murine model of sepsis, and to compare it with the effect of genetic deficiency of the endothelial isoform of nitric oxide synthase (eNOS).\nCecal ligation and puncture (CLP) was used to induce sepsis in mice. Survival rates were monitored and plasma indices of organ function were measured. Ex vivo studies included the measurement of vascular function in thoracic aortic rings, assessment of oxidative stress/cellular injury in various organs and the measurement of mitochondrial function in isolated liver mitochondria.\neNOS deficiency and aging both exacerbated the mortality of sepsis. Both eNOS-deficient and aged mice exhibited a higher degree of sepsis-associated multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), infiltration of tissues with mononuclear cells and oxidative stress. A high degree of sepsis-induced vascular oxidative damage and endothelial dysfunction (evidenced by functional assays and multiple plasma markers of endothelial dysfunction) was detected in aortae isolated from both eNOS(-/-) and aged mice. There was a significant worsening of sepsis-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, both in eNOS-deficient mice and in aged mice. Comparison of the surviving and non-surviving groups of animals indicated that the severity of endothelial dysfunction may be a predictor of mortality of mice subjected to CLP-induced sepsis.']"," Yes, endothelial dysfunction is a potential contributor to multiple organ failure and mortality in aged mice subjected to septic shock, as demonstrated by the preclinical studies using a murine model of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP).

The severity of endothelial dysfunction may serve as a predictor of mortality in mice subjected to CLP-induced sepsis.","Yes. Based on the studies in eNOS mice, we conclude that the lack of endothelial nitric oxide production, on its own, may be sufficient to markedly exacerbate the severity of septic shock. Aging markedly worsens the degree of endothelial dysfunction in sepsis, yielding a significant worsening of the overall outcome. Thus, endothelial dysfunction may constitute an early predictor and independent contributor to sepsis-associated MODS and mortality in aged mice.",1,0.815051718,0.718916226
Do short-chain fatty acids induce pro-inflammatory cytokine production alone and in combination with toll-like receptor ligands?,"['Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), produced at relatively high levels by anaerobic bacteria in bacterial vaginosis (BV), are believed to be anti-inflammatory. BV, a common alteration in the genital microbiota associated with increased susceptibility to HIV infection, is characterized by increased levels of both pro-inflammatory cytokines and SCFAs. We investigated how SCFAs alone or together with Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands affected pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion.\nCytokines were measured by ELISA. Flow was used for phenotyping and reactive oxygen species (ROS) measurement.\nShort-chain fatty acids, at 20 mM, induced interleukin (IL)-8, IL-6, and IL-1Î² release, while lower levels (0.02-2 mM) did not induce cytokine secretion. Levels >20 mM were toxic to cells. Interestingly, lower levels of SCFAs significantly enhanced TLR2 ligand- and TLR7 ligand-induced production of IL-8 and TNFÎ± in a time- and dose-dependent manner, but had little effect on lipopolysaccharide-induced cytokine release. SCFAs mediated their effects on pro-inflammatory cytokine production at least in part by inducing the generation of ROS.']"," Yes, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) can induce pro-inflammatory cytokine production, particularly when present at high concentrations (20 mM). However, lower levels of SCFAs (0.02-2 mM) do not induce cytokine secretion on their own but can significantly enhance the production of IL-8 and TNFÎ± in response to TLR2 ligands and TLR7 ligands in a time- and dose-dependent manner. This suggests that SCFAs may play a role in modulating inflammatory responses when combined with other stimuli, such as toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands. The mechanism by which SCFAs induce pro-inflammatory cytokine production appears to involve the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS).","Yes.

The results suggest that there is a rate of binding site turnover across the genome as well as at specific functional sites. They also found Sox motifs within binding intervals and a correlation between sequence conservation and binding conservation.

However, to determine whether common binding between Dichaete and SoxNeuro is conserved, they performed a detailed analysis of the binding patterns in two species. The study does not provide a definitive answer on whether this common binding is fully conserved across all Drosophila species, but it suggests that there are similarities in their binding patterns in at least some species.

For a more precise answer, you might want to look for the specific results from the detailed analysis of the binding patterns in two species mentioned in your study.","Yes. We find that, while the regulatory networks driven by Dichaete and SoxNeuro are largely conserved across the drosophilids studied, binding site turnover is widespread and correlated with phylogenetic distance. Nonetheless, binding is preferentially conserved at known cis-regulatory modules and core, independently verified binding sites. We observed the strongest binding conservation at sites that are commonly bound by Dichaete and SoxNeuro, suggesting that these sites are functionally important.

Does exposure of mouse embryonic pancreas to metformin enhance the number of pancreatic progenitors?,"['Developing beta cells are vulnerable to nutrient environmental signals. Early developmental processes that alter the number of pancreatic progenitors can determine the number of beta cells present at birth. Metformin, the most widely used oral agent for treating diabetes, alters intracellular energy status in part by increasing AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signalling. This study examined the effect of metformin on developing pancreas and beta cells.\nPancreatic rudiments from CD-1 mice at embryonic day 13.0 (E13.0) were cultured with metformin, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-Î²-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR, an AMPK activator) or vehicle control in vitro. In another set of studies, pregnant C57BL/6 mice were treated with metformin throughout gestation. Embryonic (E14.0) and neonatal pancreases were then analysed for their morphometry.\nIn vitro metformin treatment led to an increase in the proliferation and number of pancreatic duodenal homeobox 1-positive (PDX1(+)) progenitors. These results were reproduced by in vitro culture of embryonic pancreas rudiments with AICAR, suggesting that AMPK activation was involved. Similarly, metformin administration to pregnant dams induced an increase in both PDX1(+) and neurogenin 3-positive progenitors in the embryonic pancreas at E14.0 and these changes resulted in an increased beta cell fraction in neonates.']"," Yes, exposure of mouse embryonic pancreas to metformin enhances the number of pancreatic progenitors, specifically PDX1(+) and neurogenin 3-positive progenitors.

Is downregulation of Jun kinase signaling in the amnioserosa essential for dorsal closure of the Drosophila embryo?,"['During Drosophila embryogenesis, Jun kinase (JNK) signaling has been shown to play a key role in regulating the morphogenetic process of dorsal closure, which also serves as a model for epithelial sheet fusion during wound repair. During dorsal closure the JNK signaling cascade in the dorsal-most (leading edge) cells of the epidermis activates the AP-1 transcription factor comprised of DJUN and DFOS that, in turn, upregulates the expression of the dpp gene. DPP is a secreted morphogen that signals lateral epidermal cells to elongate along the dorsoventral axis. The leading edge cells contact the peripheral cells of a monolayer extraembryonic epithelium, the amnioserosa, which lies on the dorsal side of the embryo. Focal complexes are present at the dorsal-most membrane of the leading edge cells, where they contact the amnioserosa.\nWe show that the JNK signaling cascade is initially active in both the amnioserosa and the leading edge of the epidermis. JNK signaling is downregulated in the amnioserosa, but not in the leading edge, prior to dorsal closure. The subcellular localization of DFOS and DJUN is responsive to JNK signaling in the amnioserosa: JNK activation results in nuclear localization of DFOS and DJUN; the downregulation of JNK signaling results in the relocalization of DFOS and DJUN to the cytoplasm. The HINDSIGHT (HNT) Zn-finger protein and the PUCKERED (PUC) JNK phosphatase are essential for downregulation of the JNK cascade in the amnioserosa. Persistent JNK activity in the amnioserosa leads to defective focal complexes in the adjacent leading edge cells and to the failure of dorsal closure.']"," Yes, downregulation of Jun kinase (JNK) signaling in the amnioserosa is essential for dorsal closure of the Drosophila embryo.

Is matrix metalloproteinase-26 present more frequently in squamous cell carcinomas of immunosuppressed compared with immunocompetent patients?,"['Skin cancers are the most frequent malignancies in organ transplant recipients (OTRs). Squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) occur 65-250 times more frequently in OTRs and tend to be aggressive in behavior. Because matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have a central role in tumorigenesis and invasion, we investigated the epithelial and stromal MMP and tissue inhibitor of MMP (TIMP) expression profile in SCCs of immunosuppressed (IS) compared with immunocompetent (IC) patients to determine if differences could explain the more aggressive behavior of SCCs in OTRs.\nMatched pairs from 20 SCCs of IS and IC patients were studied using immunohistochemistry for MMP-1, MMP-7, MMP-8, MMP-9, MMP-13 and MMP-26 and TIMP-1 and TIMP-3.\nAmong all MMPs studied, only staining for MMP-26 was significantly more intense in cancer cells of the post-transplant group compared with the IC group (p = 0.01), whereas MMP-9 expression was more abundant in stromal macrophages surrounding SCCs of IC patients (p = 0.02).

Are functional effects of spinocerebellar ataxia type 13 mutations conserved in zebrafish Kv3.3 channels?,"['The zebrafish has been suggested as a model system for studying human diseases that affect nervous system function and motor output. However, few of the ion channels that control neuronal activity in zebrafish have been characterized. Here, we have identified zebrafish orthologs of voltage-dependent Kv3 (KCNC) K+ channels. Kv3 channels have specialized gating properties that facilitate high-frequency, repetitive firing in fast-spiking neurons. Mutations in human Kv3.3 cause spinocerebellar ataxia type 13 (SCA13), an autosomal dominant genetic disease that exists in distinct neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative forms. To assess the potential usefulness of the zebrafish as a model system for SCA13, we have characterized the functional properties of zebrafish Kv3.3 channels with and without mutations analogous to those that cause SCA13.\nThe zebrafish genome (release Zv8) contains six Kv3 family members including two Kv3.1 genes (kcnc1a and kcnc1b), one Kv3.2 gene (kcnc2), two Kv3.3 genes (kcnc3a and kcnc3b), and one Kv3.4 gene (kcnc4). Both Kv3.3 genes are expressed during early development. Zebrafish Kv3.3 channels exhibit strong functional and structural homology with mammalian Kv3.3 channels. Zebrafish Kv3.3 activates over a depolarized voltage range and deactivates rapidly. An amino-terminal extension mediates fast, N-type inactivation. The kcnc3a gene is alternatively spliced, generating variant carboxyl-terminal sequences. The R335H mutation in the S4 transmembrane segment, analogous to the SCA13 mutation R420H, eliminates functional expression. When co-expressed with wild type, R335H subunits suppress Kv3.3 activity by a dominant negative mechanism.

Do feasibility of a liver transcriptomics approach to assess bovine treatment with the prohormone dehydroepiandrosterone ( DHEA )?,"[""Within the European Union the use of growth promoting agents in animal production is prohibited. Illegal use of natural prohormones like dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is hard to prove since prohormones are strongly metabolized in vivo. In the present study, we investigated the feasibility of a novel effect-based approach for monitoring abuse of DHEA. Changes in gene expression profiles were studied in livers of bull calves treated orally (PO) or intramuscularly (IM) with 1000 mg DHEA versus two control groups, using bovine 44K DNA microarrays. In contrast to controlled genomics studies, this work involved bovines purchased at the local market on three different occasions with ages ranging from 6 to 14 months, thereby reflecting the real life inter-animal variability due to differences in age, individual physiology, season and diet.\nAs determined by principal component analysis (PCA), large differences in liver gene expression profiles were observed between treated and control animals as well as between the two control groups. When comparing the gene expression profiles of PO and IM treated animals to that of all control animals, the number of significantly regulated genes (p-value <0.05 and a fold change >1.5) was 23 and 37 respectively. For IM and PO treated calves, gene sets were generated of genes that were significantly regulated compared to one control group and validated versus the other control group using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA).

Does sub-sensory vibratory noise augment the physiologic complexity of postural control in older adults?,"['Postural control requires numerous inputs interacting across multiple temporospatial scales. This organization, evidenced by the ""complexity"" contained within standing postural sway fluctuations, enables diverse system functionality. Age-related reduction of foot-sole somatosensation reduces standing postural sway complexity and diminishes the functionality of the postural control system. Sub-sensory vibrations applied to the foot soles reduce the speed and magnitude of sway and improve mobility in older adults. We thus hypothesized that these vibration-induced improvements to the functionality of the postural control system are associated with an increase in the standing postural sway complexity.\nTwelve healthy older adults aged 74â€‰Â±â€‰8Â\xa0years completed three visits to test the effects of foot sole vibrations at 0Â\xa0% (i.e., no vibration), 70 and 85Â\xa0% of the sensory threshold. Postural sway was assessed during eyes-open and eyes-closed standing. The complexity of sway time-series was quantified using multiscale entropy.

Do proximal tubular cells promote fibrogenesis by TGF-beta1-mediated induction of peritubular myofibroblasts?,"['In proteinuric nephropathies with increasingly severe defects of the glomerular filtering barrier, interstitial fibrogenesis is a major effector of scarring. An early event in this process is the peritubular accumulation of myofibroblasts that express alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and contribute to abnormal matrix production. Common trigger factors are poorly understood. Enhanced protein trafficking may play a role by up-regulating inflammatory and fibrogenic genes in proximal tubular cells.\nThe remnant kidney model in rats was used to (1) analyze interactions between activated proximal tubular cells, peritubular cells expressing the myofibroblast marker, and inflammatory cells at time intervals (days 7, 14, and 30) after surgery, and (2) evaluate the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) on protein trafficking, fibrogenic signaling, and alpha-SMA expression.\nAbnormal uptake of ultrafiltered proteins by proximal tubular cells (IgG staining) occurred at an early stage (day 7) and was subsequently associated with macrophage and alpha-SMA+ cell accumulation into the peritubular interstitium. alpha-SMA+ cells clustered with macrophages into the interstitium. These changes were associated with appearance of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) mRNA in proximal tubular cells and in the infiltrating cells with time. At day 30, focal alpha-SMA staining also was found in the tubular cells and in peritubular endothelial cells on semithin ultracryosections.

The biological activity of NGR-hPK5 was assessed and compared with that of wild-type hPK5, in vitro and in vivo. NGR-hPK5 showed more potent antiangiogenic activity than wild-type hPK5: the former had a stronger inhibitory effect on proliferation, migration and cord formation of vascular endothelial cells, and produced a stronger antiangiogenic response in the CAM assay. To evaluate the tumor-targeting ability, both wild-type hPK5 and NGR-hPK5 were (99 m)Tc-labeled, for tracking biodistribution in the in vivo tumor model.

Evening concentrations of saliva melatonin were repeatedly measured. Sleep (23:15-07:15) was recorded by polysomnography. Sleepiness was assessed before and after nocturnal sleep. About one week later, experiments were repeated; participants who had read the novel on a tablet in the first experimental session continued reading the same novel in the physical book, and vice versa.\nThere were no differences in sleep parameters and pre-sleep saliva melatonin levels between the tablet reading and physical book reading conditions.']"," Based on the study you've described, there was no significant difference in sleep parameters or pre-sleep saliva melatonin levels when participants read a novel either on a self-luminous tablet or as a physical book during evening hours, following daytime bright light exposure. This suggests that the type of reading material (tablet vs. physical book) may not have a significant impact on sleep after daytime bright light exposure in this specific context. However, it's important to note that individual differences and other factors such as the duration and intensity of blue light exposure could still play a role in sleep disturbances associated with electronic device use during evening hours.","No. Bright light exposure during daytime has previously been shown to abolish the inhibitory effects of evening light stimulus on melatonin secretion. Our results could therefore suggest that exposure to bright light during the day - as in the present study - may help combat sleep disturbances associated with the evening use of electronic devices emitting blue light. However, this needs to be validated by future studies with larger sample populations.",0.666666667,0.889289141,0.69032189
Does femoral block provide superior analgesia compared with intra-articular ropivacaine after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction?,"['Arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction of the knee is a painful procedure requiring intensive postoperative pain management. This prospective study investigates analgesic quality after a femoral block as compared with intra-articular injection of local anesthetic.\nEighty patients scheduled for elective ACL repair under general anesthesia were included in our study. Upon completion of surgery, the patients were randomly assigned into 1 of 2 groups: femoral group (n = 40) received a femoral block with 20 mL 1% ropivacaine; intra-articular group (n = 40) received 20 mL 1% ropivacaine injected intra-articularly. During the first 24 hours after surgery, all patients received 2 g propacetamol and 100 mg ketoprofen, intravenously. Additional postoperative analgesia was available with parenteral morphine if required. Analgesic duration was defined as the time from end of surgery to the first requirement for a supplemental analgesic. Data collection included patient demographics, visual analog scale (VAS) scores, analgesic duration, and morphine use. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was used to compare the 2 groups.\nVAS score in the recovery room and during rehabilitation was higher in the intra-articular group than in the femoral group (P <.001).

PSA and DRE screening provide greater sensitivity than PSA alone; however, the increased participation rate resulting from PSA-alone screening may result in a greater detection rate.\nWe performed a survey of 13,580 healthy men undergoing PSA-only population-based screening. In addition to the basic demographic information, the survey asked whether the participant would still be willing to participate in the screening if it included a DRE. We modeled the willingness to participate to assess the effect of PSA screening versus PSA and DRE screening on the basis of previously published data and our results.\nThe results of our study indicated that only 78% of men would participate in screening that included both DRE and PSA. Thus, 7800 men of a theoretical population of 10,000 would participate in a screening that included both DRE and PSA. The positive screen rate (PSA > or = 4.0 ng/mL and/or abnormal DRE) would then have been 2013, with 472 PCa cases and 1540 negative biopsies. In the PSA-alone arm, all 10,000 men would have agreed to participate, and the positive screen rate (PSA > or = 4.0 ng/mL) would have been 1480, with 499 PCa cases and 980 negative biopsies. The PSA-alone arm would thus have detected 27 more cancers and performed 560 fewer negative biopsies.']"," Based on the data provided in your study, it appears that the inclusion of a digital rectal examination (DRE) in population-based prostate cancer screening may decrease participation rates by approximately 22%. This would result in a lower detection rate for prostate cancer compared to PSA-only screening. Specifically, in a theoretical population of 10,000 men, the number of positive screens (PSA > or = 4.0 ng/mL and/or abnormal DRE) would be 2013 with both PSA and DRE, compared to 1480 with only PSA. This means that 27 more cases of prostate cancer would be detected in the PSA-only arm, while 560 fewer negative biopsies would be performed. However, it's important to note that this is a theoretical scenario and actual results may vary depending on various factors such as population characteristics, cultural attitudes towards medical examinations, and other confounding variables. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and understand the implications for prostate cancer screening strategies.","Yes. The results of our study have demonstrated that DRE is a significant barrier to participation in PCa screening. PSA plus DRE-based programs result in fewer cases of PCa detected, with a significant increase in negative biopsies. We, therefore, suggest that future mass screening efforts include only PSA determination and omit the DRE.",0.833333333,0.829271477,0.159525319
Are antismooth muscle and antiactin antibodies indirect markers of histological and biochemical activity of autoimmune hepatitis?,"['Reactivity and titers of autoantibodies vary during the course of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), and some autoantibodies have been associated with disease activity and adverse outcomes after treatment. The aim of this study was to assess the autoantibody behavior in AIH and its significance as predictors of biochemical and histological remission. A total of 117 patients with AIH (mean age 18.6 [4-69] years) were evaluated and tested for autoantibodies at disease onset and successively (mean 3.2 [2-6] times) after a mean follow-up evaluation of 70 [20-185] months. Antismooth muscle (ASMA), antiliver kidney microsome type 1 (anti-LKM1), antiliver cytosol type 1 (anti-LC1), antimitochondrial, antinuclear (ANA), and antiactin antibodies (AAA) were determined at disease onset and 379 other times during the follow-up evaluation through indirect immunofluorescence in rodent tissues, HEp-2 cells, and human fibroblasts. Anti-SLA/LP were assessed 45 times in the follow-up evaluation of 19 patients using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Upon admission, AIH types 1 and 2 were observed in 95 and 17 patients, respectively. Five subjects had AIH with anti-SLA/LP as the sole markers. Patients initially negative for AAA did not develop these antibodies thereafter. ANA were detected de novo in six and three subjects with AIH types 1 and 2, respectively. After treatment, only ASMA (>1:80) and AAA (>1:40) were significantly associated with biochemical (76.9% and 79.8%) and histological features (100% and 100%) of disease activity (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001).']"," Yes, antismooth muscle (ASMA) and antiactin antibodies (AAA) can be considered indirect markers of histological and biochemical activity in autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), as they are significantly associated with both biochemical and histological features of disease activity.

Does live-virus exposure of vaccine-protected macaques alter the anti-HIV-1 antibody repertoire in the absence of viremia?,"['We addressed the question whether live-virus challenges could alter vaccine-induced antibody (Ab) responses in vaccinated rhesus macaques (RMs) that completely resisted repeated exposures to R5-tropic simian-human immunodeficiency viruses encoding heterologous HIV clade C envelopes (SHIV-Cs).\nWe examined the Ab responses in aviremic RMs that had been immunized with a multi-component protein vaccine (multimeric HIV-1 gp160, HIV-1 Tat and SIV Gag-Pol particles) and compared anti-Env plasma Ab titers before and after repeated live-virus exposures. Although no viremia was ever detected in these animals, they showed significant increases in anti-gp140 Ab titers after they had encountered live SHIVs. When we investigated the dynamics of anti-Env Ab titers during the immunization and challenge phases further, we detected the expected, vaccine-induced increases of Ab responses about two weeks after the last protein immunization. Remarkably, these titers kept rising during the repeated virus challenges, although no viremia resulted. In contrast, in vaccinated RMs that were not exposed to virus, anti-gp140 Ab titers declined after the peak seen two weeks after the last immunization. These data suggest boosting of pre-existing, vaccine-induced Ab responses as a consequence of repeated live-virus exposures. Next, we screened polyclonal plasma samples from two of the completely protected vaccinees by peptide phage display and designed a strategy that selects for recombinant phages recognized only by Abs present after - but not before - any SHIV challenge. With this ""subtractive biopanning"" approach, we isolated V3 mimotopes that were only recognized after the animals had been exposed to live virus. By detailed epitope mapping of such anti-V3 Ab responses, we showed that the challenges not only boosted pre-existing binding and neutralizing Ab titers, but also induced Abs targeting neo-antigens presented by the heterologous challenge virus.']"," The study suggests that repeated live-virus exposures can alter the anti-HIV-1 antibody repertoire in vaccinated macaques, even in the absence of viremia.

Is activation of fibrinolytic pathways associated with duration of supraceliac aortic cross-clamping?,"['The cause of the coagulopathy seen with supraceliac aortic cross-clamping (SC AXC) is unclear. SC AXC for 30 minutes results in both clotting factor consumption and activation of fibrinolytic pathways.

Five pigs that underwent infrarenal aortic cross-clamping (IR AXC) for 60 minutes and 11 pigs that underwent SC AXC for 30 minutes served as controls. No heparin was used. Blood samples were drawn at baseline, 5 minutes before release of the aortic clamp, and 5, 30, and 60 minutes after unclamping. Prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, platelet count, and fibrinogen concentration were measured as basic tests of hemostatic function. Thrombin-antithrombin complexes were used to detect the presence of intravascular thrombosis. Fibrinolytic pathway activation was assessed with levels of tissue plasminogen activator antigen and tissue plasminogen activator activity, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activity, and alpha2-antiplasmin activity. Statistical analysis was performed with the Student t test and repeated measures of analysis of variance.\nProthrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet count did not differ between groups at any time.

"Are gremlin 1 , frizzled-related protein , and Dkk-1 key regulators of human articular cartilage homeostasis?","['The development of osteoarthritis (OA) may be caused by activation of hypertrophic differentiation of articular chondrocytes. Healthy articular cartilage is highly resistant to hypertrophic differentiation, in contrast to other hyaline cartilage subtypes, such as growth plate cartilage. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the molecular mechanism responsible for the difference in the propensity of human articular cartilage and growth plate cartilage to undergo hypertrophic differentiation.\nWhole-genome gene-expression microarray analysis of healthy human growth plate and articular cartilage derived from the same adolescent donors was performed.

In addition, we studied a possible genetic association with OA.\nPathway analysis demonstrated decreased Wnt signaling in articular cartilage as compared to growth plate cartilage. This was at least partly due to increased expression of the bone morphogenetic protein and Wnt antagonists Gremlin 1, Frizzled-related protein (FRP), and Dkk-1 at the mRNA and protein levels in articular cartilage. Supplementation of these proteins diminished terminal hypertrophic differentiation without affecting chondrogenesis in long-bone explant cultures and chondrogenically differentiating human mesenchymal stem cells.

Do postnatal booster injections increase engraftment after in utero stem cell transplantation?,"['The primary barrier to clinical application of in utero hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation is limited donor cell engraftment. We hypothesized that limited engraftment was due to competition between host and donor cells for available niches. We reasoned that increased engraftment might be achieved by performing multiple transplants separated by brief intervals to allow time for formation of new niches. To test this we performed multiple transplants in a congenic combination to avoid confounding immunologic effects.\nC57Pep3B (H2Kb, CD45.1) mice were used as donors of adult bone marrow and C57Bl/6 (H2Kb, CD45.2) mice were used as 14-day-gestation fetal recipients.

Is hemorrhage More Prevalent than Brain Injury in Early Trauma Deaths : The Golden Six Hours?,"['Under the trimodal distribution, most trauma deaths occur within the first hour. Determination of cause of death without autopsy review is inaccurate. The goal of this study is to determine cause of death, in hourly intervals, in trauma patients who died in the first 24 h, as determined by autopsy.\nTrauma deaths that occurred within 24 h at a Level I trauma center were reviewed over a six-year period ending December 2005. Timing of death was separated into 0-1, 1-3, 3-6, 6-12 and 12-24 h intervals.

Does autophagy promote apoptosis of mesenchymal stem cells under inflammatory microenvironment?,"['Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been widely applied to treat various inflammatory diseases. Inflammatory cytokines can induce both apoptosis and autophagy in MSCs.

Do locally adapted fish populations maintain small-scale genetic differentiation despite perturbation by a catastrophic flood event?,"['Local adaptation to divergent environmental conditions can promote population genetic differentiation even in the absence of geographic barriers and hence, lead to speciation. Perturbations by catastrophic events, however, can distort such parapatric ecological speciation processes. Here, we asked whether an exceptionally strong flood led to homogenization of gene pools among locally adapted populations of the Atlantic molly (Poecilia mexicana, Poeciliidae) in the Cueva del Azufre system in southern Mexico, where two strong environmental selection factors (darkness within caves and/or presence of toxic H2S in sulfidic springs) drive the diversification of P. mexicana. Nine nuclear microsatellites as well as heritable female life history traits (both as a proxy for quantitative genetics and for trait divergence) were used as markers to compare genetic differentiation, genetic diversity, and especially population mixing (immigration and emigration) before and after the flood.\nHabitat type (i.e., non-sulfidic surface, sulfidic surface, or sulfidic cave), but not geographic distance was the major predictor of genetic differentiation. Before and after the flood, each habitat type harbored a genetically distinct population. Only a weak signal of individual dislocation among ecologically divergent habitat types was uncovered (with the exception of slightly increased dislocation from the Cueva del Azufre into the sulfidic creek, El Azufre). By contrast, several lines of evidence are indicative of increased flood-induced dislocation within the same habitat type, e.g., between different cave chambers of the Cueva del Azufre.']"," Yes, despite the perturbation caused by a catastrophic flood event, locally adapted populations of the Atlantic molly (Poecilia mexicana) in the Cueva del Azufre system in southern Mexico maintained small-scale genetic differentiation. This suggests that these populations are resilient to such events and continue to exhibit parapatric ecological speciation processes, driven by strong environmental selection factors. However, there was a weak signal of individual dislocation among ecologically divergent habitat types, with increased dislocation within the same habitat type after the flood. This indicates that while the overall genetic differentiation was maintained, there was some mixing and displacement of individuals within habitats following the flood event.","Yes. The virtual absence of individual dislocation among ecologically different habitat types indicates strong natural selection against migrants. Thus, our current study exemplifies that ecological speciation in this and other systems, in which extreme environmental factors drive speciation, may be little affected by temporary perturbations, as adaptations to physico-chemical stressors may directly affect the survival probability in divergent habitat types.",1,0.647384654,0.362562608

Does eVI1 promote tumor growth via transcriptional repression of MS4A3?,"['The transcription factor Ecotropic Virus Integration site 1 (EVI1) regulates cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, and its overexpression contributes to an aggressive course of disease in myeloid leukemias and other malignancies. Notwithstanding, knowledge about the target genes mediating its biological and pathological functions remains limited.

Reporter constructs containing various parts of the MS4A3 upstream region were employed in luciferase assays, and binding of EVI1 to the MS4A3 promoter was investigated by chromatin immunoprecipitation. U937 derivative cell lines experimentally expressing EVI1 and/or MS4A3 were generated by retroviral transduction, and tested for their tumorigenicity by subcutaneous injection into severe combined immunodeficient mice.\nGene expression microarray analysis identified 27 unique genes that were up-regulated, and 29 unique genes that were down-regulated, in response to EVI1 induction in the human myeloid cell line U937T. The most strongly repressed gene was MS4A3, and its down-regulation by EVI1 was confirmed by qRT-PCR in additional, independent experimental model systems. MS4A3 mRNA levels were also negatively correlated with those of EVI1 in several published AML data sets. Reporter gene assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that EVI1 regulated MS4A3 via direct binding to a promoter proximal region.

The cell viability was detected using an MTT (3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. Quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting analyses were performed to examine the changes in the expression of downstream target genes and proteins. To disrupt PI3K/AKT signaling, we used the PI3K inhibitor perifosine.\nCell invasion assays demonstrated that CDX1 restricts trophoblast cell invasiveness. In contrast, quantification of cumulative cell numbers revealed that CDX1 did not affect cell proliferation. Western blotting analysis and quantitative real time PCR demonstrated that MMP-9 expression was reduced, whereas TIMP-1 expression was increased in CDX1-overexpressed cells.

In contrast, CDX1 was regulated by the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.']"," Yes, based on the provided context, it appears that cDX1 does restrict the invasion of HTR-8/SVneo trophoblast cells, as demonstrated in the cell invasion assays. This restriction seems to be due to the inhibition of MMP-9 expression and an increase in TIMP-1 expression, as shown by western blotting analysis and quantitative real time PCR. However, overexpression of cDX1 did not affect PI3K/AKT signaling in HTR-8/SVneo trophoblast cells, but cDX1 was regulated by the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.","Yes. Altogether, we found that in trophoblast cells, CDX1 reduced invasion independently of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.

The effects of free OXA, the empty carrier, and CSO-SA/OXA micelles were tested using human CRC cell lines in vitro and in vivo.\nThe micelles showed excellent internalization ability that increased OXA accumulation both in CRC cells and tissues. Furthermore, CSO-SA/OXA micelles could either increase the cytotoxicity of OXA against the bulk cancer cells or reverse chemoresistance of CSLC subpopulations in vitro. Intravenous administration of CSO-SA/OXA micelles effectively suppressed the tumor growth and reduced CD133+/CD24+ cell (putative CRC CSLC markers) compared with free OXA treatment, which caused CSLC enrichment in xenograft tumors (P < 0.05).']"," Yes, the study suggests that oxaliplatin-incorporated micelles (CSO-SA/OXA) can eliminate both cancer stem-like cells (CSLCs) and bulk cancer cells in colorectal cancer (CRC).

Do hyposmia and cardiovascular dysautonomia correlatively appear in early-stage Parkinson 's disease?,"[""Olfactory dysfunction is considered to precede motor symptoms and early markers of Parkinson's disease (PD), while the relative time at which cardiovascular dysautonomia appears in PD is not well understood. To assess the appearance of cardiovascular dysautonomia in PD, we evaluated its relation to olfactory dysfunction in early-stage PD patients.\nTwenty-three non-demented PD patients within 2 years from the onset of motor symptoms were enrolled. We evaluated olfactory dysfunction by the Odor Stick Identification Test for Japanese (OSIT-J) and analyzed its relationship to the results of other cardiovascular autonomic tests and cardiac (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy.\nThere was a correlation between olfactory scores and increased blood pressure in both the norepinephrine (rÂ\xa0=Â\xa00.75, pÂ\xa0<Â\xa00.0001, nÂ\xa0=Â\xa021) and dobutamine (rÂ\xa0=Â\xa00.57, pÂ\xa0=Â\xa00.0087, nÂ\xa0=Â\xa020) infusion tests and cardiac MIBG uptake (rÂ\xa0=Â\xa00.42, pÂ\xa0=Â\xa00.049, nÂ\xa0=Â\xa023).

Does iL-6 Secreted from Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts mediate Chemoresistance in NSCLC by Increasing Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Signaling?,"['The tumor microenvironment is composed of different types of stromal cells that represent a key component of tumor progression. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) secrete several factors that promote tumorigenesis. The purpose of this study was to clarify the role of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) secreted from CAFs in the communication between CAFs and NSCLC cells that modulates chemoresistance.\nWe used standard NSCLC cell lines as well as NSCLC cells, lung normal fibroblasts, and CAFs obtained from specimens from patients with NSCLC to evaluate phenotypic changes. Immunohistochemical analysis was also utilized to examine the stromal changes in tumor specimens obtained from patients with NSCLC who had undergone chemotherapy.\nIL-6 significantly increased transforming growth factor-Î²1-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) changes in cancer cells. Cisplatin treatment increased expression of transforming growth factor-Î² in cancer cells, and the conditioned media from cancer cells activated fibroblasts and increased their IL-6 production. Expression of IL-6 was increased in CAFs compared with in lung normal fibroblasts. The conditioned media from CAFs induced EMT and resistance to cisplatin in NSCLC cells through IL-6 signaling. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that stromal IL-6 expression was correlated with EMT changes in cancer cells as well as with a diffuse distribution of smooth muscle actin-stained fibroblasts.

Data and parameters were obtained from electronic patient records.\nA total of 162 patients were readmitted within 30 days from their initial admission (11% of the cohort). Of this group, 139 (86%) readmittances were unpreventable or planned. Readmissions caused by missed diagnosis or insufficient treatment accounted for 8% and 6%, respectively. The median time until readmission in these cases were two and four and a half days, respectively. The median time to readmission for the unpreventable readmissions ranged from 13 to 18.5 days.']"," Yes, readmittance rates within seven days can be useful in measuring the quality of emergency departments, as they provide insights into the timeliness and effectiveness of initial treatment and diagnosis. However, it's important to note that not all readmissions are preventable, and some may be planned or unrelated to the initial care provided. In this study, only a small percentage (8%) of readmissions were due to missed diagnosis or insufficient treatment, suggesting that these events are relatively rare in this specific context. The median time until readmission for these cases was two and four and a half days, which could indicate potential areas for improvement in the timeliness of care. On the other hand, unpreventable readmissions had a longer median time to readmission (ranging from 13 to 18.5 days), suggesting that these may not be directly related to the quality of care provided at the emergency department.","Yes. In terms of patient safety, our data support a seven-day observation period for readmission rates when measuring or monitoring quality of care in emergency departments.",0.6,0.294676891,0.490189185
Does nF-kappaB p65 ( RelA ) homodimer used distinct mechanisms to recognize DNA targets?,"[""The NF-kappaB family of dimeric transcription factors regulates the expression of several genes by binding to a variety of related DNA sequences. One of these dimers, p65(RelA), regulates a subclass of these targets. We have shown previously that p65 binds to the 5'-GGAA T TTTC-3' sequence asymmetrically. In that complex one subunit base specifically interacts with the preferred 5' half site and the other subunit binds non-specifically to the 3' half site.\nHere we describe the crystal structures of two new p65-DNA complexes. One complex contains a pseudosymmetric 5'-GGAA T TTCC-3' DNA sequence taken from the enhancer of the gene encoding interleukin 8 (IL-8) and the other contains the asymmetric 5'-GGAA T TCCC-3' target DNA taken from the enhancer of the gene encoding type VII collagen. As expected, the global positioning of the dimer on both DNA targets is roughly symmetric, however, the hydrogen-bonding patterns at the protein-DNA interfaces differ significantly. One of the p65 monomers in complex with the asymmetric DNA binds to an extra base pair located immediately upstream of the 5'-GGAA-3' half site. We also show that p65 binds to these targets with almost equal affinity and that different residues have variable roles in binding different kappaB targets.""]"," Yes, nF-kappaB p65 (RelA) homodimer uses distinct mechanisms to recognize DNA targets, as demonstrated by the crystal structures of two new p65-DNA complexes.

Is current evidence insufficient to define an optimal threshold for intervention in isolated type II endoleak after endovascular aneurysm repair?,"['To report a systematic review and meta-regression of the association between the threshold for intervention in patients with isolated type II endoleak after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) and the fate of the aneurysm sac.\nMedline, trial registries, conference proceedings, and article reference lists were searched to identify case series reporting sac outcomes following a specific treatment threshold for isolated type II endoleak. Articles were classified by the threshold for intervention as conservative, selective (intervention for >5-mm sac expansion or persistent type II endoleak >6 months), or aggressive (any type II endoleak or persistent for >3 months) and sac outcomes were extracted for review. Standard meta-regression to estimate the pooled odds ratios (OR), presented with the 95% confidence interval (CI), was performed to identify whether an aggressive, selective, or conservative threshold for intervention was associated with sac expansion or sac regression.\nTen series were analyzed that reported the outcomes of isolated type II endoleak in 231 patients; of these, 56 patients were treated at an aggressive threshold, 104 at a selective threshold, and 71 at a conservative threshold.

Significance was set at P < 0.05 with a trend toward significance at P < 0.1.\nType II dens fracture caused trends toward increased sagittal neutral zone and lateral bending range of motion at C1/2. Spinal motions with the dens screw alone could not be differentiated from physiologic limits. Significant reductions in motion were observed at C0/1 and C1/2 in flexion-extension and axial rotation due to the halo-vest, applied individually or combined with the dens screw. At C1/2, the halo-vest combined with the dens screw generally allowed the smallest average percentages of intact motion: 3% in axial rotation, 17% in flexion-extension, and 18% in lateral bending.']"," The biomechanical study you described investigates the stability provided by a halo-vest and odontoid screw fixation for Type II odontoid fracture. The results suggest that while a simulated Type II dens fracture causes trends toward increased sagittal neutral zone and lateral bending range of motion at C1/2, the application of the dens screw alone does not significantly increase upper cervical spine instability compared to physiologic limits. However, the halo-vest, applied individually or combined with the dens screw, significantly reduces spinal motions (flexion-extension, axial rotation) at C0/1 and C1/2, particularly when used in combination. At C1/2, the halo-vest combined with the dens screw generally allows the smallest average percentages of intact motion for axial rotation, flexion-extension, and lateral bending (3%, 17%, and 18% respectively). This indicates that the halo-vest and odontoid screw fixation can provide significant stabilization to the upper cervical spine following a Type II dens fracture.","Yes. The present reduction in C1/2 motion observed, due to the halo-vest and dens screw combined is similar to previously reported immobilization provided by the polyaxial screw/rod system and transarticular screw fixation combined with wiring. The present biomechanical data may be useful to clinicians when choosing an appropriate treatment for those with Type II dens fracture.",0.8,0.337984848,0.851691991
Does miR-200c Targets CDK2 and suppress Tumorigenesis in Renal Cell Carcinoma?,"['miRNA expression profiles are widely investigated in the major cancers, but their specific roles and functions in cancers have not yet to be fully elucidated. In this study, miRNA expression profiles were determined in clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCC) and in matched normal kidney tissues by using a miRNA microarray platform which covers a total of 851 human miRNAs. Differential expression of 74 miRNAs were identified between ccRCC specimens and their matched adjacent noncancerous tissues, of which 30 were significantly upregulated in ccRCCs, and the other 44 were downregulated (fold change â‰¥ 2, P < 0.05). Interestingly, miR-200c was commonly downregulated in ccRCC specimens and ccRCC cell lines with significant functional consequences. Growth curve and FACS assay indicated that overexpression of miR-200c suppressed cell growth and induced cell-cycle arrest at G0-G1 phases in SN12-PM6 and 786-O cells. Furthermore, miR-200c could suppress in vivo tumor growth of SN12-PM6 cells in mice. Bioinformatics exposed cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) as a potential target of miR-200c, which was validated using a luciferase reporter assay. Mechanistic investigations revealed that miR-200c was directly responsible for suppressing the expression of CDK2 in ccRCC cell lines and xenografts.

Is nox4 required for maintenance of the differentiated vascular smooth muscle cell phenotype?,"['The mechanisms responsible for maintaining the differentiated phenotype of adult vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are incompletely understood. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been implicated in VSMC differentiation, but the responsible sources are unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of Nox1 and Nox4-derived ROS in this process.\nPrimary VSMCs were used to study the relationship between Nox homologues and differentiation markers such as smooth muscle alpha-actin (SM alpha-actin), smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SM-MHC), heavy caldesmon, and calponin. We found that Nox4 and differentiation marker genes were downregulated from passage 1 to passage 6 to 12, whereas Nox1 was gradually upregulated. Nox4 co-localized with SM alpha-actin-based stress fibers in differentiated VSMC, and moved into focal adhesions in de-differentiated cells. siRNA against nox4 reduced NADPH-driven superoxide production in serum-deprived VSMCs and downregulated SM-alpha actin, SM-MHC, and calponin, as well as SM-alpha actin stress fibers. Nox1 depletion did not decrease these parameters.']"," Yes, it appears that Nox4 is required for the maintenance of the differentiated vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) phenotype. The study shows that Nox4 and differentiation marker genes are downregulated as VSMCs become less differentiated over time, while Nox1 is upregulated. Additionally, siRNA against nox4 reduced NADPH-driven superoxide production in serum-deprived VSMCs and decreased the expression of various differentiation markers such as SM-alpha actin, SM-MHC, and calponin. These findings suggest that Nox4 plays a role in maintaining the differentiated state of VSMCs by producing ROS necessary for their maintenance.",Yes. Nox4-derived ROS are critical to the maintenance of the differentiated phenotype of VSMCs.

Does ghrelin influence gastric emptying in obese subjects?,"['To evaluate the relationship between fasting plasma concentrations of ghrelin and gastric emptying in obese individuals compared with lean subjects.\nWe included 20 obese patients (9 men and 11 women, BMI > 30 kg/m2) and 16 nonobese control subjects (7 men and 9 women, BMI < or = 25 kg/m2). Gastric emptying of solids (egg sandwich labeled with radionuclide) was measured at 120 minutes with (99m)Tc-single photon emission computed tomography imaging. Ghrelin and leptin were analyzed by radioimmunoassay and ELISA methods, respectively.\nThe gastric half-emptying time was similar in obese men and women (67.8 +/- 14.79 vs. 66.6 +/- 13.56 minutes) but significantly shorter (p < 0.001) than in the control population (men: 88.09 +/- 11.72 minutes; women: 97.25 +/- 10.31 minutes).

Total cellular ATP turnover and relative glycolytic dependency was determined by simultaneous measurements of oxygen consumption and lactate synthesis rates and total protein synthesis was determined by autoradiographic quantification of the incorporation of 35S-labelled methionine and cysteine into protein.\nMicroarray analysis allowed differentiation between genes induced at low oxygen only at normal extracellular pH (pHe), genes induced at low oxygen at both normal and low pHe, and genes induced at low pHe independent of oxygen concentration. Several genes were found to be upregulated by acidosis independent of oxygenation. Acidosis resulted in a more wide-scale change in gene expression profiles than hypoxia including upregulation of genes involved in the translation process, for example Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A, isoform 2 (EIF4A2), and Ribosomal protein L37 (RPL37). Acidosis suppressed overall ATP turnover and protein synthesis by 50%. Protein synthesis, but not total ATP production, was also suppressed under hypoxic conditions. A dramatic decrease in ATP turnover (SiHa) and protein synthesis (both cell lines) was observed when hypoxia and low pHe were combined.']"," Yes, simultaneous Hypoxia and Low Extracellular pH do suppress overall metabolic rate and protein synthesis in vitro. This is supported by the findings that acidosis (low extracellular pH) suppressed overall ATP turnover and protein synthesis by 50%, and protein synthesis was also suppressed under hypoxic conditions. Furthermore, a dramatic decrease in ATP turnover and protein synthesis was observed when both hypoxia and low pH were combined.","Yes. We demonstrate here that the influence of hypoxia and acidosis causes different responses, both in gene expression and in de novo protein synthesis, depending on whether the two factors induced alone or overlapping, and as such it is important for in vivo studies to take this into account.",0.5,0.927202907,

Does cardiac Hypertrophy be Inhibited by a Local Pool of cAMP Regulated by Phosphodiesterase 2?,"[""Chronic elevation of 3'-5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels has been associated with cardiac remodeling and cardiac hypertrophy. However, enhancement of particular aspects of cAMP/protein kinase A signaling seems to be beneficial for the failing heart. cAMP is a pleiotropic second messenger with the ability to generate multiple functional outcomes in response to different extracellular stimuli with strict fidelity, a feature that relies on the spatial segregation of the cAMP pathway components in signaling microdomains.\nHow individual cAMP microdomains affect cardiac pathophysiology remains largely to be established. The cAMP-degrading enzymes phosphodiesterases (PDEs) play a key role in shaping local changes in cAMP. Here we investigated the effect of specific inhibition of selected PDEs on cardiac myocyte hypertrophic growth.\nUsing pharmacological and genetic manipulation of PDE activity, we found that the rise in cAMP resulting from inhibition of PDE3 and PDE4 induces hypertrophy, whereas increasing cAMP levels via PDE2 inhibition is antihypertrophic. By real-time imaging of cAMP levels in intact myocytes and selective displacement of protein kinase A isoforms, we demonstrate that the antihypertrophic effect of PDE2 inhibition involves the generation of a local pool of cAMP and activation of a protein kinase A type II subset, leading to phosphorylation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells.""]"," Yes, cardiac hypertrophy can be inhibited by a local pool of cAMP regulated by Phosphodiesterase 2 (PDE2).

In contrast to endothelial cells, little is known about the regulation of t-PA gene expression and secretion in astrocytes.\nThe aims of the present study were to investigate whether t-PA gene expression is regulated by retinoids and the protein kinase C (PKC) activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) in human astrocytes, and to study whether t-PA is stored and subject to regulated release from these cells, as with endothelial cells.\nNative human astrocytes were treated with RA and/or PMA. mRNA was quantified by real-time RT-PCR and protein secretion determined by ELISA. Intracellular t-PA immunoreactivity in astrocytes was examined by immunocyto- and histochemistry.\nRA and/or PMA induced a time-dependent increase in t-PA mRNA and protein levels in astrocytes, reaching 10-fold after combined treatment. This was associated with increased amounts of t-PA storage in intracellular granular structures. Both forskolin and histamine induced regulated release of t-PA. The presence of t-PA in reactive astrocytes was confirmed in human brain tissue.']"," Yes, the study found that retinoids and activation of PKC (specifically with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or PMA) induce tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) expression and storage in human astrocytes. Additionally, the study also demonstrated that t-PA is stored in intracellular granular structures within these cells and can be released in a regulated manner upon stimulation with forskolin or histamine. Furthermore, the presence of t-PA was confirmed in reactive astrocytes in human brain tissue.","Yes. These data show that RA and PKC activation induce a strong up-regulation of t-PA expression in astrocytes, and increased intracellular storage pools. Moreover, a regulated release of t-PA can be induced from these cells. This raises the possibility that astrocytes contribute to the regulation of extracellular t-PA levels in the CNS.",1,0.548662858,0.571610896
Does acetylcholine activate protein kinase C-alpha in pulmonary venous smooth muscle?,"[""The authors investigated whether acetylcholine-induced contraction in pulmonary venous smooth muscle (PVSM) is associated with the activation of specific protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms.\nIsolated canine pulmonary venous rings without endothelium were suspended in modified Krebs-Ringer's buffer for measurement of isometric tension. The effects of nonspecific PKC inhibition (bisindolylmaleimide I; 3 x 10 m) and conventional PKC isoform inhibition (GÃ¶7936 10 m) on the acetylcholine dose-response relation were assessed. The expression of conventional PKC isoforms (alpha, beta, gamma), novel PKC isoforms (delta, epsilon, theta), and atypical PKC isoforms (zeta, iota, mu) was measured in PVSM cells by Western blot analysis. The immunofluorescence technique and confocal microscopy were used to localize the cellular distribution of PKC isoforms before and after the addition of acetylcholine.\nAcetylcholine caused dose-dependent contraction in E-pulmonary veins. Pretreatment with bisindolylmaleimide I or GÃ¶7936 attenuated acetylcholine contraction. PKC-alpha, -iota, -mu, and -zeta were expressed, whereas PKC-beta, -gamma, -delta, -epsilon;, and -theta were not expressed in PVSM cells. Immunofluorescence staining for PKC isoforms showed that in unstimulated cells, PKC-alpha and PKC-mu were detected only in the cytoplasm. PKC-iota and PKC-zeta also exhibited a cytoplasmic immunofluorescence pattern, which was especially abundant in the perinuclear zone. Activation with acetylcholine induced translocation of PKC-alpha from cytoplasm to membrane, whereas acetylcholine had no effect on the other PKC isoforms. Translocation of PKC-alpha in response to acetylcholine was blocked by the muscarinic receptor antagonist, atropine.""]"," Yes, acetylcholine activates protein kinase C-alpha (PKC-alpha) in pulmonary venous smooth muscle (PVSM). This activation leads to translocation of PKC-alpha from the cytoplasm to the membrane. The activation is blocked by the muscarinic receptor antagonist, atropine. Other PKC isoforms such as PKC-iota, PKC-zeta, and PKC-mu are also expressed in PVSM cells but only PKC-alpha shows a significant response to acetylcholine stimulation.",Yes. Acetylcholine contraction is attenuated by PKC inhibition in PVSM. Acetylcholine induces translocation of PKC-alpha from cytoplasm to membrane in PVSM. These results suggest that PKC-dependent acetylcholine contraction in PVSM may involve activation and translocation of PKC-alpha.,1,0.91541485,0.922484719

Differences between the two groups were evaluated by One-way ANOVA.\nThe apoptosis of LEC induced by high glucose was time-and dose-dependent obviously. As the glucose concentration increased and duration prolonged, the expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 was decreased and pro-apoptotic protein Bax was increased.Intracellular ROS and MDA induced by high glucose were increased significantly with dose-and time-dependence. Compared with 5.5 mmol/L group, ROS generation increased significantly in the concentration of 15.0 mmol/L (F = 14.06, P = 0.035), 25.0 mmol/L (F = 17.46, P = 0.000), 35.0 mmol/L (F = 16.58, P = 0.001), 45.0 mmol/L (F = 12.88, P = 0.000) and were statistically significant.

Compared with 5.5 mmol/L group, the content of MDA were significantly increased in 15.0 mmol/L (F = 1.177, P = 0.035), 25.0 mmol/L (F = 1.704, P = 0.000), 35.0 mmol/L (F = 2.412, P = 0.001) and 45.0 mmol/L (F = 2.347, P = 0.000) glucose medium and were statistically significant. Compared with 5.5 mmol/L cultured group, the content of MDA were significantly increased at 6 h (F = 1.704, P = 0.014), 12 h (F = 5.676, P = 0.001), 24 h (F = 3.325, P = 0.001), 48 h (F = 6.669, P = 0.000), 72 h (F = 3.011, P = 0.000) in LEC cultured group by 25.0 mmol/L high glucose and were statistically significant. When resveratrol (5.0, 15.0, 25.0, 35.0 mg/L) was added to 25.0 mmol/L glucose medium, respectively, the apoptotic cells were decreased, the expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax was decreased and anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 was increased.Intracellular ROS (compared with the basic concentration of 5.5 mmol/L, F values were 14.76, 7.018, 13.96, 4.733, 1.921, P values were 0.000, 0.000, 0.003, 0.086, 0.100 respectively) and MDA (compared with the basic concentration of 5.5 mmol/L, F values were 2.454, 1.108, 1.630, 1.563, 2.250, P values were 0.000, 0.001, 0.026, 0.068, 0.183 respectively) were decreased. MnSOD expression was increased, iNOS and NF-ÎºB activation were inhibited.']"," Yes, the study suggests that Resveratrol alleviates oxidative injury from high glucose-induced human lens epithelial cells. The mechanism appears to involve a decrease in apoptotic cells, a reduction in intracellular ROS and MDA levels, an increase in the expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, a decrease in the expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax, inhibition of iNOS and NF-ÎºB activation, and an increase in MnSOD expression. However, it's important to note that this is based on an experimental study and more research may be needed to confirm these findings and fully understand the underlying mechanisms.","Yes. Resveratrol could alleviates oxidative injury from high glucose-induced LEC, and inhibited of iNOS-mediated oxidative damage through inhibiting the activities of NF-ÎºB could be the mechanism of this effect.",0.9,0.972256423,0.434207701
Does dementia after stroke increase the risk of long-term stroke recurrence?,"['Although risk factors for first stroke have been identified, the predictors of long-term stroke recurrence are less well understood. We performed the present study to determine whether dementia diagnosed three months after stroke onset is an independent risk factor for long-term stroke recurrence.\nWe examined 242 patients (age = 72.0 +/- 8.7 years) hospitalized with acute ischemic stroke who had survived the first three months without recurrence and followed them to identify predictors of long-term stroke recurrence. We diagnosed dementia three months after stroke using modified DSM-III-R criteria based on neuropsychological and functional assessments. The effects of conventional stroke risk factors and dementia status on survival free of recurrence were estimated using Kaplan-Meier analyses, and the relative risks (RR) of recurrence were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models.\nDementia (RR = 2.71, 95% CI = 1.36 to 5.42); cardiac disease (RR = 2.18, CI = 1.15 to 4.12); and sex, with women at higher risk (RR = 2.03, CI = 1.01 to 4.10), were significant independent predictors of recurrence, while education (RR = 1.90, CI = 0.77 to 4.68), admission systolic blood pressure >160 mm Hg (RR = 1.80, CI = 0.94 to 3.44) and alcohol intake exceeding 160 grams per week (RR = 1.86, CI = 0.79 to 4.38) were weakly related.']"," Yes, the study suggests that dementia diagnosed three months after a stroke increases the risk of long-term stroke recurrence. The relative risk of recurrence for patients with dementia was found to be 2.71 times higher than those without dementia. Other factors associated with an increased risk of recurrence include cardiac disease and being female, while education, admission systolic blood pressure greater than 160 mm Hg, and alcohol intake exceeding 160 grams per week were weakly related to the risk of recurrence.","Yes. Our results suggest that dementia significantly increases the risk of long-term stroke recurrence, with additional independent contributions by cardiac disease and sex. Cognitive impairment may be a surrogate marker for multiple vascular risk factors and larger infarct volume that may serve to increase the risk of recurrence. Alternatively, less aggressive medical management of stroke patients with cognitive impairment or noncompliance of such patients with medical therapy may be bases for an increased rate of stroke recurrence.",1,0.794113451,0.590338891
Is abdominal obesity associated with autonomic nervous derangement in healthy Asian obese subjects?,"['Subjects with obesity had autonomic nervous abnormalities. This study investigated autonomic nervous modulation in subjects with obesity and its association with the indices of obesity, especially the body mass index and waist circumference, by heart rate variability analysis.\nForty-seven adults with a body mass index (in kg/m(2)) greater than 28 were recruited as the obese group and 30 subjects with a body mass index less than 23 were recruited as the control group. Anthropometric measures and heart rate variability measures were obtained for both groups. The correlation between heart rate variability measures and the anthropometric measures was assessed in subjects with obesity.\nSubjects with obesity had lower normalized low-frequency power and normalized high-frequency power than those of the control group. The body height, body weight, waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio correlated significantly with the spectral heart rate variability measures in Asian subjects with obesity, whereas the body mass index did not.']"," Yes, abdominal obesity (as indicated by waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio) is associated with autonomic nervous derangement in healthy Asian obese subjects, as shown by lower normalized low-frequency power and normalized high-frequency power in heart rate variability analysis. However, body mass index did not show a significant correlation with these measures.","Yes. Abdominal obesity, rather than general obesity, was related to autonomic nervous derangement in Asian subjects with obesity.

Does chemokine receptor CXCR4 enhance proliferation in pancreatic cancer cells through AKT and ERK dependent pathways?,"['We previously detected CXCR4 expression in pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) tissues and demonstrated CXCR4-enhanced proliferation of PanIN cells. Our objective was to determine if the CXCR4 targets AKT and ERK mediate CXCR4-dependent PanIN and pancreatic cancer proliferation.\nWe exposed cultured murine-derived PanIN, invasive pancreatic cancer (5143PDA) and liver metastasis (5143LM) cells, and human pancreatic cancer PANC-1 cells to CXCL12, the specific CXCR4 ligand, and measured phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2. The roles of AKT and ERK1/2 in CXCR4-dependent cell proliferation were assessed by the PI/3K-AKT small molecular inhibitor LY294002 and the ERK signaling inhibitor UO126.\nWe discovered increases in phosphorylation of AKT in PanIN, 5143PDA, and PANC-1 cells but no increase in 5143LM cells after exposure to CXCL12. We also observed that exposure to CXCL12 over varying periods phosphorylated ERK1/2 in an oscillatory pattern for all cell lines. Administration of LY294002 resulted in complete abrogation of CXCL12-induced proliferation in PanIN, 5143LM, and PANC-1 cells but not 5143PDA cells, whereas UO126 resulted in complete abrogation of CXCR4-enhanced proliferation in all cell lines.']"," Yes, the chemokine receptor CXCR4 enhances proliferation in pancreatic cancer cells through AKT and ERK dependent pathways. The results suggest that AKT plays a significant role in CXCR4-dependent proliferation of PanIN, 5143LM, and PANC-1 cells, while ERK signaling is crucial for the proliferation of all cell lines tested (PanIN, 5143PDA, 5143LM, and PANC-1). However, it's important to note that the role of AKT seems more specific to certain cell types, as CXCL12-induced proliferation was completely abrogated by LY294002 in PanIN, 5143LM, and PANC-1 cells but not in 5143PDA cells. On the other hand, UO126 inhibited CXCR4-enhanced proliferation in all cell lines tested.",Yes.

Does miR-1 downregulation cooperate with MACC1 in promoting MET overexpression in human colon cancer?,"['MET, the tyrosine kinase receptor for hepatocyte growth factor, is frequently overexpressed in colon cancers with high metastatic tendency. We aimed to evaluate the role of its negative regulators, miR-1 and miR-199a*, and its transcriptional activator, the metastasis-associated in colon cancer 1 (MACC1), in controlling MET expression in human colon cancer samples.\nThe expression of MET, miR-1, miR-199a*, and MACC1 was evaluated by real-time PCR in 52 matched pairs of colorectal cancers and nontumoral surrounding tissues. The biological role of miR-1 in controlling MET expression and biological activity was assessed in colon cancer cells either by its forced expression or by AntagomiR-mediated inhibition.\nMiR-1 was downregulated in 84.6% of the tumors and its decrease significantly correlated with MET overexpression, particularly in metastatic tumors. We found that concurrent MACC1 upregulation and miR-1 downregulation are required to elicit the highest increase of MET expression. Consistent with a suppressive role of miR-1, its forced in vitro expression in colon cancer cells reduced MET levels and impaired MET-induced invasive growth. Finally, we identified a feedback loop between miR-1 and MET, resulting in their mutual regulation.']"," Yes, the study suggests that downregulation of miR-1 cooperates with MACC1 in promoting MET overexpression in human colon cancer. The decrease in miR-1 expression significantly correlates with MET overexpression, particularly in metastatic tumors. This correlation is more pronounced when both miR-1 and MACC1 are concurrently upregulated or downregulated. Furthermore, the study indicates a feedback loop between miR-1 and MET, where the forced expression of miR-1 in colon cancer cells reduces MET levels and impairs MET-induced invasive growth.",Yes. This study identifies an oncosuppressive role of miR-1 in colorectal cancer in which it acts by controlling MET expression through a feedback loop. Concomitant downregulation of miR-1 and increase of MACC1 can thus contribute to MET overexpression and to the metastatic behavior of colon cancer cells.,1,0.751924786,0.658220484
"Is oligodendrocyte PTEN required for myelin and axonal integrity , not remyelination?","['Repair of myelin injury in multiple sclerosis may fail, resulting in chronic demyelination, axonal loss, and disease progression. As cellular pathways regulated by phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN; eg, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase [PI-3K]) have been reported to enhance axon regeneration and oligodendrocyte maturation, we investigated potentially beneficial effects of Pten loss of function in the oligodendrocyte lineage on remyelination.\nWe characterized oligodendrocyte numbers and myelin sheath thickness in mice with conditional inactivation of Pten in oligodendrocytes, Olig2-cre, Pten(fl/fl) mice. Using a model of central nervous system demyelination, lysolecithin injection into the spinal cord white matter, we performed short- and long-term lesioning experiments and quantified oligodendrocyte maturation and myelin sheath thickness in remyelinating lesions.\nDuring development, we observed dramatic hypermyelination in the corpus callosum and spinal cord. Following white matter injury, however, there was no detectable improvement in remyelination. Moreover, we observed progressive myelin sheath abnormalities and massive axon degeneration in the fasciculus gracilis of mutant animals, as indicated by ultrastructure and expression of SMI-32, amyloid precursor protein, and caspase 6.']"," Yes, oligodendrocyte PTEN is required for myelin and axonal integrity, but it does not seem to be essential for remyelination in the context of repairing myelin injury in multiple sclerosis. Instead, the study suggests that loss of function of Pten in the oligodendrocyte lineage leads to progressive myelin sheath abnormalities and massive axon degeneration following white matter injury.","Yes. These studies indicate adverse effects of chronic Pten inactivation (and by extension, activation PI-3K signaling) on myelinating oligodendrocytes and their axonal targets. We conclude that PTEN function in oligodendrocytes is required to regulate myelin thickness and preserve axon integrity.

The following parameters were analyzed in 194 consecutive patients: age, gender, past history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, past history of ischemic stroke, presence of ischemic heart disease or cardioembolic disease, current antiplatelet treatment, current alcohol overuse, smoking, Glasgow Coma Scale score (GSS) at admission, volume and location (deep or lobar) of ICH, ventricular extension, glycemia and temperature at admission, and leukoaraiosis. We correlated these data with the 30-day mortality identifying the independent predictors by logistic regression analysis.\nFactors independently associated with 30-day mortality were: age, Glasgow Coma Scale score at admission, ICH volume, ventricular extension, glucose level at admission, and previous antiplatelet use.']"," Yes, previous antiplatelet therapy is an independent predictor of 30-day mortality after spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage, according to the study you provided. This means that patients who were on previous antiplatelet treatment had a higher risk of death within 30 days compared to those who were not on such therapy. However, it's important to note that this is based on the data from one specific study and more research may be needed to confirm these findings in different populations.","Yes. Apart from the classical outcome predictors, the previous use of antiplatelet agents and the glucose value at admission are independent predictors of 30-day mortality in patients suffering a supratentorial ICH.",0.571428571,0.795445043,0.739482294
Are anti-inflammatory effects of inhaled nitric oxide optimized at lower oxygen concentration in experimental Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonia?,"['To evaluate whether antiinflammatory effects of inhaled nitric oxide (NO) in experimental Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonia may be affected by oxygen levels in association with cytokine response and NO synthase (NOS) activity.\nHealthy adult rats were intratracheally instilled with live Klebsiella pneumoniae to induce pneumonia (P) or with sterile saline as a control (C) group. Group C was allocated to room air (CA) and inhaled NO (CNO, NO = 20 parts per million) groups. Group P was divided into 6 groups (n = 8 - 10) exposed to room air (PA), inhaled NO (PNO), low oxygen (40%, PLO), inhaled NO and low oxygen (PLONO), high oxygen (100%, PHO), and inhaled NO and high oxygen (98%, PHONO). After 24 h exposure, intraalveolar cells, expression of proinflammatory cytokines, nuclear transcription factor (NF-kappaB), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and NOS activities, characteristic of lung inflammatory mechanisms, were measured.\nAll the pneumonia groups had pneumonia whereas CA and CNO had no or mild lung inflammation. Compared to the PA, significantly decreased recruitment of alveolar neutrophils was found in the PNO, along with lower NF-kappaB and MPO activity, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Similar trends were found between the PLONO and PLO in alleviation of lung inflammation. However, PHONO significantly enhanced recruitment of alveolar neutrophils and pulmonary MPO activity associated with increased TNF-alpha. Inhaled NO improved bacterial clearance, reduced total proteins in alveoli, and ICAM-1 expression irrespective of oxygen levels. Inhaled NO and/or low and high oxygen partially restored constitutive NOS activity whereas high oxygen or together with inhaled NO depressed inducible NOS activity.']"," Yes, the anti-inflammatory effects of inhaled nitric oxide (NO) appear to be optimized at lower oxygen concentrations in experimental Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonia. This is based on the findings that inhalation of NO reduced recruitment of alveolar neutrophils, NF-kappaB and MPO activity, TNF-alpha, and ICAM-1 expression compared to room air (PA) in the pneumonia groups. Furthermore, these effects were more pronounced when NO was combined with low oxygen (PLONO) compared to high oxygen (PHONO). However, it's important to note that inhaled NO also improved bacterial clearance and reduced ICAM-1 expression irrespective of oxygen levels. The study also suggests that high oxygen or together with inhaled NO depressed inducible NOS activity while partially restoring constitutive NOS activity.","Yes. The overall beneficial effects of inhaled NO in anti-inflammation in the mature lungs with K. pneumoniae pneumonia are in favor of a combination with lower level of oxygen, which warrants clinical verification in the treatment of lung inflammatory injury.",0.4,0.77873342,0.513008624
Does sequence specificity incompletely define the genome-wide occupancy of Myc?,"['The Myc-Max heterodimer is a transcription factor that regulates expression of a large number of genes. Genome occupancy of Myc-Max is thought to be driven by Enhancer box (E-box) DNA elements, CACGTG or variants, to which the heterodimer binds in vitro.\nBy analyzing ChIP-Seq datasets, we demonstrate that the positions occupied by Myc-Max across the human genome correlate with the RNA polymerase II, Pol II, transcription machinery significantly better than with E-boxes. Metagene analyses show that in promoter regions, Myc is uniformly positioned about 100 bp upstream of essentially all promoter proximal paused polymerases with Max about 15 bp upstream of Myc. We re-evaluate the DNA binding properties of full length Myc-Max proteins. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay results demonstrate Myc-Max heterodimers display significant sequence preference, but have high affinity for any DNA. Quantification of the relative affinities of Myc-Max for all possible 8-mers using universal protein-binding microarray assays shows that sequences surrounding core 6-mers significantly affect binding. Compared to the in vitro sequence preferences,Myc-Max genomic occupancy measured by ChIP-Seq is largely, although not completely, independent of sequence specificity.']"," The statement suggests that while Myc-Max does exhibit a preference for certain DNA sequences (E-boxes), its genome-wide occupancy is more significantly correlated with the RNA polymerase II transcription machinery and less dependent on sequence specificity as determined by ChIP-Seq analysis. This implies that other factors, such as the presence of paused polymerases in promoter regions, may play a more crucial role in determining Myc-Max's genomic occupancy than just the presence of E-boxes. However, it is important to note that sequence specificity does still have some influence on Myc-Max's binding, but not completely.",Yes. We quantified the affinity of Myc-Max to all possible 8-mers and compared this with the sites of Myc binding across the human genome. Our results indicate that the genomic occupancy of Myc cannot be explained by its intrinsic DNA specificity and suggest that the transcription machinery and associated promoter accessibility play a predominant role in Myc recruitment.,1,0.733226344,0.560306305
Does video electroencephalography monitoring differentiate between epileptic and non-epileptic seizures?,"['Epilepsy is often misdiagnosed and approximately one in every four patients diagnosed with refractory epilepsy does not have epilepsy, but instead non-epileptic seizures.

This means that VEM can help confirm or rule out epilepsy in a significant number of patients. The study also showed that the highest diagnostic yield was obtained when patients had seizures with ictal electroencephalography paroxysms during VEM, indicating that capturing these events is crucial for accurate diagnosis.","Yes. Several patients without epilepsy are treated as if they had epilepsy.

Does s-adenosyl methionine improve early viral responses and interferon-stimulated gene induction in hepatitis C nonresponders?,"['Less than half of patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) achieve sustained viral clearance after pegylated interferon (peginterferon) and ribavirin therapy.

Does albumin at the start of peritoneal dialysis predict the development of peritonitis?,"['Both peritonitis and serum albumin level are associated with morbidity and mortality in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Severe cases of peritonitis result in hypoalbuminemia. However, it is not clear whether hypoalbuminemia predicts the development of peritonitis.\nWe performed a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database from six centers in western Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Incident PD patients with a Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score at the start of PD therapy and serum albumin level measured within 30 days of initiation were selected. Poisson regression was used to analyze predictors of peritonitis.\nThree hundred ninety-three patients had a CCI score and serum albumin level measured at the start of PD therapy. Overall peritonitis rate was 0.65 episodes/dialysis-year. Significant univariate predictors were albumin level (rate ratio [RR], 0.79 per 1-g/dL [10-g/L] increase; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65 to 0.95; P = 0.015), male sex (P = 0.003), and being dialyzed in the Veterans Administration (RR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.48 to 2.62; P < 0.001) or other center (RR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.92 to 5.62; P < 0.001).

Does recipient inflammation affect the frequency and magnitude of immunization to transfused red blood cells?,"['Most alloantigens on transfused red blood cells (RBCs) are weakly immunogenic, with only a 2 to 6 percent overall immunization rate even in patients receiving multiple transfusions. Although recipient genetics may contribute to responder and/or nonresponder status, in most cases HLA type does not predict humoral response to RBC antigens. In contrast, rates of alloimmunization do correspond to the underlying disease status of transfusion recipients, suggesting that acquired host factors may play an important role. In this context, it was hypothesized that the inflammatory status of a transfusion recipient would influence immunization to transfused RBCs.\nA novel murine model for alloimmunization to RBC antigens was developed with the mHEL mouse, which expresses hen egg lysozyme (HEL) as a model blood group antigen. Leukoreduced mHEL RBCs were transfused into wild-type recipient mice, and anti-HEL responses were monitored.

Does high glucose activate ChREBP-mediated HIF-1Î± and VEGF expression in human RPE cells under normoxia?,"['Because retina-damaging angiogenesis is controlled by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and people with higher glucose intakes are more susceptible to retinal complications that may be due to increased VEGF, it is crucial to elucidate relations between glucose exposure and VEGF expression.

Real-time RT-PCR for HIF-1Î± and VEGF and ELISA for VEGF indicated that high glucose is associated with elevated production of HIF-1Î±-induced VEGF, an established inducer of neovascularization, in the RPE cells. IF analyses showed that, although ChREBP was expressed under both low (5.6 mM) and high (25 mM) glucose conditions, it appeared more in the nuclear region than in the cytosol of the RPE cells after the high glucose treatment. ChIP analyses suggested a HIF-1Î± gene promoter association with ChREBP under the high glucose condition. These results imply that RPE cells use cytosolic ChREBP as a glucose sensor to up-regulate HIF-1Î± expression.']"," Yes, the study suggests that high glucose activates ChREBP-mediated HIF-1Î± and VEGF expression in human RPE cells under normoxia. The findings indicate that elevated glucose levels induce and stabilize HIF-1Î±, leading to increased production of VEGF, an established inducer of neovascularization, in the RPE cells. Additionally, ChREBP was found to translocate from the cytosol to the nucleus under high glucose conditions, suggesting its role as a glucose sensor for up-regulating HIF-1Î± expression.","Yes. These results suggest a high glucose-induced, ChREBP-mediated, and normoxic HIF-1Î± activation that may be partially responsible for neovascularization in both diabetic and age-related retinopathy.",1,0.884923682,0.674392839
Do new reference charts for testicular volume in Dutch children and adolescents allow the calculation of standard deviation scores?,"[""Accurate calculations of testicular volume standard deviation (SD) scores are not currently available.

Do natural regulatory T cells limit angiotensin II-induced aneurysm formation and rupture in mice?,"['Abdominal aortic aneurysm is an inflammatory disease leading to destructive vascular remodeling and ultimately to lethal aortic rupture. Despite its frequent association with atherosclerosis, compelling studies have shown striking differences and potentially opposite roles of T-cell helper responses in aneurysm as compared with atherosclerosis, casting doubt on the relevance and suitability of T-cell-targeted therapies in this context.\nHere, we show that selective depletion of T regulatory (Treg) cells using a CD25-specific monoclonal antibody significantly enhances the susceptibility of C57Bl/6 mice to angiotensin II-induced abdominal aortic aneurysm and promotes aortic rupture (n=25-44 mice/group). Similar results are observed in angiotensin II-treated Cd80(-/-)/Cd86(-/-) or Cd28(-/-) mice with impaired Treg cell homeostasis (n=18-23 mice/group). Treg cell depletion is associated with increased immune cell activation and a blunted interleukin (IL)-10 anti-inflammatory response, suggesting an immunoinflammatory imbalance. Interestingly, Il-10(-/-) mice (n=20 mice/group) show increased susceptibility to angiotensin II-induced abdominal aortic aneurysm and aortic rupture and are insensitive to Treg cell depletion.

Do pAPC and the Wnt5a/Ror2 pathway control the invagination of the otic placode in Xenopus?,"['Paraxial protocadherin (PAPC) plays a crucial role in morphogenetic movements during gastrulation and somitogenesis in mouse, zebrafish and Xenopus. PAPC influences cell-cell adhesion mediated by C-Cadherin. A putative direct adhesion activity of PAPC is discussed. PAPC also promotes cell elongation, tissue separation and coordinates cell mass movements. In these processes the signaling function of PAPC in activating RhoA/JNK and supporting Wnt-11/PCP by binding to frizzled 7 (fz7) is important.\nHere we demonstrate by loss of function experiments in Xenopus embryos that PAPC regulates another type of morphogenetic movement, the invagination of the ear placode. Knockdown of PAPC by antisense morpholinos results in deformation of the otic vesicle without altering otocyst marker expression. Depletion of PAPC could be rescued by full-length PAPC, constitutive active RhoA and by the closely related PCNS but not by classical cadherins. Also the cytoplasmic deletion mutant M-PAPC, which influences cell adhesion, does not rescue the PAPC knockdown. Interestingly, depletion of Wnt5a or Ror2 which are also expressed in the otocyst phenocopies the PAPC morphant phenotype.']"," Yes, according to the provided context, it appears that pAPC and the Wnt5a/Ror2 pathway control the invagination of the otic placode in Xenopus. The loss of function experiments show that when PAPC is knocked down, there is a deformation of the otic vesicle without altering otocyst marker expression. This phenotype can also be observed when Wnt5a or Ror2 are depleted.",Yes. PAPC signaling via RhoA and Wnt5a/Ror2 activity are required to keep cells aligned in apical-basal orientation during invagination of the ear placode. Since neither the cytoplasmic deletion mutant M-PAPC nor a classical cadherin is able to rescue loss of PAPC we suggest that the signaling function of the protocadherin rather than its role as modulator of cell-cell adhesion is required during invagination of the ear placode.,1,0.635221914,0.466343293

Is a Drosophila Smyd4 homologue a muscle-specific transcriptional modulator involved in development?,"['SET and MYND domain (Smyd) proteins are involved in the transcriptional regulation of cellular proliferation and development in vertebrates. However, the in vivo functions and mechanisms by which these proteins act are poorly understood.\nWe have used biochemical and genetic approaches to study the role of a Smyd protein in Drosophila. We identified eleven Drosophila genes that encode Smyd proteins. CG14122 encodes a Smyd4 homologue that we have named dSmyd4. dSmyd4 repressed transcription and recruited class I histone deacetylases (HDACs). A region of dSmyd4 including the MYND domain interacted directly with approximately 150 amino acids at the N-termini of dHDAC1 and dHDAC3. dSmyd4 interacts selectively with Ebi, a component of the dHDAC3/SMRTER co-repressor complex. During embryogenesis dSmyd4 was expressed throughout the mesoderm, with highest levels in the somatic musculature. Muscle-specific RNAi against dSmyd4 resulted in depletion of the protein and lead to severe lethality. Eclosion is the final moulting stage of Drosophila development when adult flies escape from the pupal case. 80% of dSmyd4 knockdown flies were not able to eclose, resulting in late pupal lethality. However, many aspects of eclosion were still able to occur normally, indicating that dSmyd4 is likely to be involved in the development or function of adult muscle.']"," Yes, based on the information provided, it appears that a Drosophila Smyd4 homologue (dSmyd4) functions as a muscle-specific transcriptional modulator involved in development. The study suggests that dSmyd4 represses transcription and interacts with class I histone deacetylases, specifically dHDAC1 and dHDAC3, through its MYND domain. During embryogenesis, dSmyd4 is expressed throughout the mesoderm, with highest levels in the somatic musculature. Knockdown of dSmyd4 leads to severe lethality during the final moulting stage (eclosion) of Drosophila development, suggesting that it plays a role in the development or function of adult muscle.",Yes. Repression of transcription by dSmyd4 and the involvement of this protein in development suggests that aspects of Smyd protein function are conserved between vertebrates and invertebrates.,1,0.717947672,0.476412028
Does 5-HT ( 1A ) receptor activation improve anti-cataleptic effects of levodopa in 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats?,"['In Parkinsonâ€ºs disease (PD) prolong use of L-DOPA causes some motor disorders such as wearing-off and L-DOPA induced dyskinesia (LID).

This is based on the findings from the study you've described, where the administration of 8-OHDAPT along with L-DOPA resulted in a significant improvement in the anti-cataleptic effect as measured by the bar-test.","Yes. The results showed that L-DOPA had anti-cataleptic effect only until the day of 15, and its effect was decreased on the day of 20. On the day of 21, rats were co-injected with three different doses of 8-OHDAPT (0.1, 0.5 and 2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) and L-DOPA (15 mg/kg, ip). 8-Hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OHDAPT) improved anti-cataleptic effect of L-DOPA at the dose of 0.5 mg/kg. Moreover the effect of 8-OHDAPT on anti-cataleptic effect of L-DOPA (15 mg/kg, ip) was abolished by 1-(2-methyoxyphenyl)-4-[4-(2-phthalamido) butyl] piperazine hydrobromide (NAN-190; 0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) as a 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist. According to the obtained results, it may be concluded that activation of 5-HT(1A) receptors by 8-OHDAPT may improve anti-cataleptic effect of L-DOPA in a 6-OHDA- induced rat model of PD.

We assessed D2 receptor modulation of corticostriatal inputs onto medium spiny neurons in the adult ventral striatum using in vitro whole-cell current clamp recordings.\nThe D2/D3 agonist quinpirole (5 ÂµM) enhanced cortically driven medium spiny neuron synaptic responses in slices taken from adult rats treated with vehicle during adolescence, as in untreated adult rats. However, in slices from mature rats treated with olanzapine during adolescence, quinpirole reduced medium spiny neuron activation. The magnitude of decrease was similar to previous observations in untreated, prepubertal rats.

The other alcohol session was performed after the subjects had taken 75 mg ASA once daily for 7 days. On both occasions, venous blood samples were obtained at exactly timed intervals for a period of 3.5 h.\nThe blood-ethanol profiles showed large interindividual variations for both experiments. After treatment with ASA, the maximum blood-ethanol concentration was distinctly lower in seven subjects, almost unchanged in two subjects and increased in one subject. Overall, a statistically significant decrease in the peak blood-ethanol concentration was observed. The time required to reach peak blood-ethanol levels was somewhat longer after treatment with ASA. Although the areas under the concentration-time profiles were smaller after ASA treatment, these differences were not statistically significant. The concentrations of paracetamol in plasma were lower when ethanol was ingested after treatment with ASA and the areas under the concentration-time curves (0-170 min) were smaller.']"," Based on the study provided, it appears that low-dose aspirin may influence the bioavailability of orally administered alcohol, but not significantly so in terms of the area under the concentration-time profile. The peak blood-alcohol concentration was found to be lower after treatment with ASA in seven out of ten subjects, suggesting a potential effect. However, it's important to note that the study involved a small number of participants and further research would be needed to confirm these findings and understand the mechanisms behind them. The study did not find evidence to support the hypothesis that this effect is due to altered gastric emptying as measured by the paracetamol absorption test.","Yes. Intake of low-dose ASA (75 mg daily) tends to delay the absorption of a moderate dose of ethanol, which results in lower peak blood-ethanol concentrations and smaller areas under the concentration-time curves. The underlying mechanism seems to be delayed gastric emptying as indicated by the paracetamol absorption test.",0.75,0.740848977,0.561658861
Do chitin-binding domains of Escherichia coli ChiA mediate interactions with intestinal epithelial cells in mice with colitis?,"['Inducible chitinase 3-like-1 is expressed by intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and adheres to bacteria under conditions of inflammation.

Stool/tissue samples were collected and analyzed.\nLF82-Î”chiA had significantly less adhesion to IEC lines than LF82. Complementation of LF82-Î”chiA with the LF82 chiA gene, but not chiA from nonpathogenic (K12) E coli, increased adhesion. We identified 5 specific polymorphisms in the chitin-binding domain of LF82 chiA (at amino acids 362, 370, 378, 388, and 548) that differ from chiA of K12 and were required for LF82 to interact directly with IECs. This interaction was mediated by an N-glycosylated asparagine in chitinase 3-like-1 (amino acid 68) on IECs.

Does l-carnosine inhibit high-glucose-mediated matrix accumulation in human mesangial cells by interfering with TGF-Î² production and signalling?,"['Transforming growth factor beta is recognized as a major cytokine in extracellular matrix (ECM) pathobiology as occurs in diabetic nephropathy. While experimental studies have advanced a protective role of carnosine for diabetic complications, a link between carnosine, TGF-Î² and matrix accumulation remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that L-carnosine inhibits TGF-Î² production and signalling, thereby reducing hyperglycaemia-associated ECM accumulation.\nHuman mesangial cells (MC) were cultured in high-glucose (HG, 25 mM D-glucose) medium alone or in HG medium to which 20 mM L-carnosine was added. Collagen VI (Col6) and fibronectin (FN) deposition and messenger RNA expression were studied. In addition, TGF-Î² production and activation of Smad1/5/8 (ALK1) and Smad2/3 (ALK5) pathways were assessed.\nUnder HG conditions, deposition of Col6 and FN were increased 1.4- and 1.6-fold. This was significantly inhibited on the protein and messenger RNA level by L-carnosine. TGF-Î² production increased under HG conditions but was completely normalized by addition of L-carnosine. Addition of exogenous TGF-Î² could not overcome the effect of L-carnosine on Col6 and FN expression, indicating additionally interference with TGF-Î² downstream signalling. Along the same line, L-carnosine reduced TGF-Î²-mediated Smad2 phosphorylation, suggesting an inhibitory effect on ALK5 signalling. ALK1 signalling remained unchanged. Under HG conditions, pharmacologic inhibition of ALK5 prevented Col6 accumulation but did not change FN deposition.']"," Yes, the study suggests that l-carnosine inhibits high-glucose-mediated matrix accumulation in human mesangial cells by interfering with TGF-β production and signaling. Specifically, it reduces the expression of collagen VI (Col6) and fibronectin (FN), decreases TGF-β production, and inhibits the phosphorylation of Smad2 (a component of the ALK5 signaling pathway). These effects seem to be independent of any impact on ALK1 signaling. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of ALK5 prevents Col6 accumulation but does not affect FN deposition.","Yes. L-carnosine can modulate matrix accumulation in two ways. Firstly, inhibition of TGF-Î² production might result in an overall inhibition of matrix accumulation and secondly, L-carnosine inhibits TGF-Î²-induced matrix accumulation, most likely via inhibition of the ALK5 pathway.",1,0.902233501,0.742728254

Is growth attenuation under saline stress mediated by the heterotrimeric G protein complex?,"['Plant growth is plastic, able to rapidly adjust to fluctuation in environmental conditions such as drought and salinity. Due to long-term irrigation use in agricultural systems, soil salinity is increasing; consequently crop yield is adversely affected. It is known that salt tolerance is a quantitative trait supported by genes affecting ion homeostasis, ion transport, ion compartmentalization and ion selectivity. Less is known about pathways connecting NaCl and cell proliferation and cell death. Plant growth and cell proliferation is, in part, controlled by the concerted activity of the heterotrimeric G-protein complex with glucose. Prompted by the abundance of stress-related, functional annotations of genes encoding proteins that interact with core components of the Arabidopsis heterotrimeric G protein complex (AtRGS1, AtGPA1, AGB1, and AGG), we tested the hypothesis that G proteins modulate plant growth under salt stress.\nNa+ activates G signaling as quantitated by internalization of Arabidopsis Regulator of G Signaling protein 1 (AtRGS1). Despite being components of a singular signaling complex loss of the GÎ² subunit (agb1-2 mutant) conferred accelerated senescence and aborted development in the presence of Na+, whereas loss of AtRGS1 (rgs1-2 mutant) conferred Na+ tolerance evident as less attenuated shoot growth and senescence. Site-directed changes in the GÎ± and GÎ²Î³ protein-protein interface were made to disrupt the interaction between the GÎ± and GÎ²Î³ subunits in order to elevate free activated GÎ± subunit and free GÎ²Î³ dimer at the plasma membrane.

The study you've described suggests that components of this complex, such as AtRGS1, AtGPA1, AGB1, and AGG, are involved in salt tolerance pathways. Specifically, the loss of the GÎ² subunit (agb1-2 mutant) accelerated senescence and aborted development under Na+ stress, while the loss of AtRGS1 (rgs1-2 mutant) conferred Na+ tolerance. Additionally, site-directed changes in the GÎ± and GÎ²Î³ protein-protein interface that increased free activated GÎ± subunit and free GÎ²Î³ dimer at the plasma membrane also conferred sodium tolerance. Glucose in the growth media improved survival under salt stress in wild-type plants but not in agb1-2 or rgs1-2 mutants, further suggesting a role for this complex in salt tolerance.","Yes. These results demonstrate a direct role for G-protein signaling in the plant growth response to salt stress. The contrasting phenotypes of agb1-2 and rgs1-2 mutants suggest that G-proteins balance growth and death under salt stress. The phenotypes of the loss-of-function mutations prompted the model that during salt stress, G activation promotes growth and attenuates senescence probably by releasing ER stress.",1,0.873428997,0.63889709

At diagnosis, the expression of TNFÎ± and IFNÎ³ was reduced in ALL patients compared to healthy controls, with this reduction being more pronounced in high-risk and T-ALL patients.","Yes. We conclude that gene-polymorphisms of the regulatory/anti-inflammatory cytokines, TGFÎ² and IL10, but not of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, IFNÎ³ and TNFÎ±, have an impact on prognosis and risk-group of ALL. However, the reduced capacity to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines at diagnosis may serve as another important, functional risk factor. These data may help in further risk stratification and adaptation of therapy-intensity in paediatric patients with ALL.",1,0.604710985,0.518490481
"Is lifetime sport and leisure activity participation associated with greater bone size , quality and strength in older men?","['It remains uncertain whether long-term participation in regular weight-bearing exercise confers an advantage to bone structure and strength in old age. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between lifetime sport and leisure activity participation on bone material and structural properties at the axial and appendicular skeleton in older men (>50 years).\nWe used dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to assess hip, spine and ultradistal (UD) radius areal bone mineral density (aBMD) (n=161), quantitative ultrasound (QUS) to measure heel bone quality (n=161), and quantitative computed tomography (QCT) to assess volumetric BMD, bone geometry and strength at the spine (L(1)-L(3)) and mid-femur (n=111). Current (>50+ years) and past hours of sport and leisure activity participation during adolescence (13-18 years) and adulthood (19-50 years) were assessed by questionnaire. This information was used to calculate the total time (min) spent participating in sport and leisure activities and an osteogenic index (OI) score for each participant, which provides a measure of participation in weight-bearing activities.\nRegression analysis revealed that a greater lifetime (13-50+ years) and mid-adulthood (19-50 years) OI, but not total time (min), was associated with a greater mid-femur total and cortical area, cortical bone mineral content (BMC), and the polar moment of inertia (I (p)) and heel VOS (p ranging from <0.05 to <0.01). These results were independent of age, height (or femoral length) and weight (or muscle cross-sectional area). Adolescent OI scores were not found to be significant predictors of bone structure or strength. Furthermore, no significant relationships were detected with areal or volumetric BMD at any site. Subjects were then categorized into either a high (H) or low/non-impact (L) group during adolescence (13-18 years) and adulthood (19-50+ years) according to their OI scores during each of these periods. Three groups were subsequently formed to reflect weight-bearing impact categories during adolescence and then adulthood: LL, HL and HH. Compared to the LL group, mid-femur total and cortical area, cortical BMC and I (p) were 6.5-14.2% higher in the HH group. No differences were detected between the LL and HL groups.']"," Yes, lifetime sport and leisure activity participation, particularly during mid-adulthood, is associated with greater bone size, quality, and strength in older men. This includes larger mid-femur total and cortical area, increased cortical bone mineral content (BMC), higher polar moment of inertia (I(p)), and better heel bone quality as measured by VOS. These associations were independent of age, height, weight, and muscle cross-sectional area. However, adolescent OI scores did not significantly predict bone structure or strength. The study also found that compared to those with low/non-impact activity during both adolescence and adulthood, those with high impact activities during these periods had significantly greater mid-femur total and cortical area, cortical BMC, and I(p).","Yes. In conclusion, these findings indicate that long-term regular participation in sport and leisure activities categorized according to an osteogenic index [but not the total time (min) spent participating in all sport and leisure activities] was an important determinant of bone size, quality and strength, but not BMD, at loaded sites in older men. Furthermore, continued participation in weight-bearing exercise in early to mid-adulthood appears to be important for reducing the risk of low bone strength in old age.",0.8,0.767571461,0.736533247
Are autophagy and VMP1 expression early cellular events in experimental diabetes?,"['We have described VMP1 as a new protein which expression triggers autophagy in mammalian cells. Here we show that experimental diabetes activates VMP1 expression and autophagy in pancreas beta cells as a direct response to streptozotocin (STZ).\nMale Wistar rats were treated with 65 mg/kg STZ and pancreas islets from untreated rats were incubated with 1 mM STZ.\nRT-PCR analysis shows early VMP1 induction after STZ treatment. In situ hybridization reveals VMP1 mRNA in islet beta cells. Electron microscopy shows chromatin aggregation and autophagy morphology that was confirmed by LC3 expression and LC3-VMP1 co-localization. Apoptotic cell death and the reduction of beta cell pool are evident after 24 h treatment, while VMP1 is still expressed in the remaining cells. VMP1-Beclin1 colocalization in pancreas tissue from STZ-treated rats suggests that VMP1-Beclin1 interaction is involved in the autophagic process activation during experimental diabetes.

Does lipoxin A4 suppress the development of endometriosis in an ALX receptor-dependent manner via the p38 MAPK pathway?,"[""Lipoxins can function as endogenous 'breaking signals' in inflammation and play important roles in the progression of endometriosis. In this study, we further investigated the molecular mechanism by which lipoxin A4 (LXA4 ) suppresses the development of endometriosis.\nPrimary endometriotic stromal cells (ESCs) were treated with IL-1Î², or pre-incubated with LXA4 before incubation with IL-1Î². The LXA4 receptor (ALX receptor) antagonist Boc-2 and gene-silencing approaches were used to study the involvement of the ALX receptor in anti-inflammatory signalling responses in ESCs. An animal model of endometriosis was induced in BALB/c mice by i.p. injection of an endometrium-rich fragment.\nDecreased levels of LXA4 and 15-LOX-2 expression but increased expression of AXL receptors were observed in endometriotic tissues. LXA4 inhibited the release of inflammatory factors and phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in IL-1Î²-induced ESCs, an effect mediated by ALX receptors. LXA4 inhibited the proliferation of ESCs, as indicated by reduced DNA replication, caused G0 /G1 phase cell cycle arrest and down-regulated the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen in ESCs. LXA4 also attenuated the invasive activity of ESCs mainly by suppressing the expression and activity of MMP-9. In vivo, we further confirmed that LXA4 could inhibit the progression of endometriosis by acting as an anti-inflammatory.""]"," Yes, lipoxin A4 (LXA4) suppresses the development of endometriosis in an ALX receptor-dependent manner via the p38 MAPK pathway. This is demonstrated through various experiments in this study, including treating primary endometriotic stromal cells with LXA4 and observing its effects on inflammatory factors, cell proliferation, and invasive activity. The results indicate that LXA4 inhibits the release of inflammatory factors, phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, and the proliferation of endometriotic stromal cells (ESCs), while also suppressing the expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and causing G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, in an animal model of endometriosis, LXA4 was found to inhibit the progression of endometriosis by acting as an anti-inflammatory.","Yes.

"Is experimental murine colitis regulated by two genetic loci , including one on chromosome 11 that regulates IL-12 responses?","[""Immunogenetic analysis of experimental colitis may contribute to the further unraveling of the complex genetic basis of the inflammatory bowel diseases, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.\nGenetic regions associated with susceptibility to trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis were identified in a genome-wide linkage analysis in F2 progeny of colitis-susceptible SJL/J and -resistant C57BL/6 mice. An immunogenetic approach was then used to further study the pathophysiologic role of one of the identified loci.\nWe identified susceptibility loci on chromosomes 9 (Tnbs1) and 11 (Tnbs2). Tnbs2 harbors the interleukin (IL)-12 p40 gene, a likely candidate gene because IL-12 is a known central mediator for both experimental colitis and human Crohn's disease. We therefore tested the ability of colitis-susceptible and -resistant strains to mount IL-12 responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a strong inducer of IL-12 that is abundantly present in the intestine. We observed a remarkably higher serum IL-12 response to LPS in susceptible SJL/J mice. Subsequently, we showed that the genetic region regulating the IL-12 response to LPS colocalizes with Tnbs2.""]"," Yes, experimental murine colitis is regulated by two genetic loci, one of which is on chromosome 11 and appears to regulate IL-12 responses.

Is the prognostic value of plasma galectin-3 in chronic heart failure patients maintained when treated with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists?,"['Galectin-3 (Gal-3) is considered as a myocardial fibrosis biomarker with prognostic value in heart failure (HF). Since aldosterone is a neurohormone with established fibrotic properties, we aimed to investigate if mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) would modulate the prognostic value of Gal-3.\nThe IBLOMAVED cohort comprised 427 eligible chronic HF patients (CHF) with echocardiography and heart failure biomarkers assessments (BNP). After propensity score matching CHF patients for cardiovascular risk factors, to form balanced groups, Gal-3 levels were measured at baseline in plasma from patients treated with MRAs (MRA-Plus, n=101) or not (MRA-Neg, n=101).

HFSR was graded according to NCI-CTC criteria in both trials. Time to first occurrence of HFSR was described per cycle and HFSR developing during cycles 1 and 2 was defined as 'early HFSR'. Baseline characteristics between the patient groups with or without HFSR were compared using Mann-Whitney-U, Fisher's exact or Ï‡(2)-test, as appropriate. Haematological and non-haematological toxicities observed in both groups were compared using Fisher's exact test.

It has been found prevalent also in many other parts of China since 1955, and presently, 28 out of 31 provinces (autonomous regions, or municipalities) have been proved to be its endemic areas. The total number of cases is 1,256,431 from 1950 to 1997, with 44,304 death (3.53%). 50-100 thousands of cases could be registered annually since 1981 when the presence of the Rattus-type HFRS was first identified serologically in China, with the highest peak in 1986 (115,985 cases). Three types of endemicity have been differentiated: the Apodemus-type, the Rattus-type and the mixed type of the two, by their peculiar seasonal distributions of cases and by methods of serotyping (HI, MAbs serotyping kits). The epidemiologic features of the Rattus-type HFRS are quite different from that of the Apodemus-type. 67 species of vertebrates were found to harbor hantavirus antigen or antibodies, but the chief or primary reservoir hosts are Apodemus agrarius and Rattus norvegicus only. Besides the commonly recognized enzootic mode of transmission (via contacts with the reservoir rodents or their excreta), mite transmission (including certain species of gamasid mites, and chigger mites) has been identified as the potential vectors and reservoir hosts with HFRS. Vertical transmission had been found in pregnant patients with HFRS, and in all three chief host rodents (Apodemus agrarius, Rattus norvegicus, the laboratory rats). The relatively high inapparent infection rates in the population of endemic areas of the Rattus-type HFRS after big outbreaks (8%-20%) are suggested to play a significant role in the gradual decline of the incidence of HFRS in that areas. Three kinds of inactivated vaccines against HFRS (the golden hamster kidney cell vaccine, the Mongolian gerbil kidney cell vaccine and the purified suckling mouse brain vaccine) have been successively developed and proved highly effective in the prevention of HFRS.']","1.
