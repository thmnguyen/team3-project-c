            "In the context of All India Radio, it is important to note that its development was influenced by several individuals who worked towards promoting Indian classical music through radio broadcasting. One such person was K.S. Krishnaswamy (1896-1975), a musicologist and musician who served as the first Director of Music for All India Radio from 1936 to 1947. He played a crucial role in shaping the programming policies and establishing the standards for classical music broadcasting on AIR.\n",

            "Krishnaswamy was deeply influenced by Vishnu Digambar Paluskar's work, as he studied under him at Gandharva Mahavidyalaya and later became one of his most prominent disciples. Krishnaswamy's contributions to All India Radio helped establish it as a platform for promoting Indian classical music and fostering its growth and development in the 20th century.\n",
